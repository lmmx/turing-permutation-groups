Below is a **careful, line‐by‐line** transcription of both the typed text (which is partially crossed out or obscured by handwritten notes) and the more legible handwritten annotations. Where words or symbols are illegible or too faint to read confidently, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or explanatory notes. In places where Turing’s notation is particularly dense, I have tried to reproduce it faithfully.

Th eorem III

The limiting distributions for f are constant throughout
the cosets of a certain self-conjugate subgroup H₁ of H. H₁
consists of all expressions xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
of the form Uₘ₁ Uₘ₂ ... Uₘₚ where the sum ∑mᵢ is 0. The factor
group H / H₁ is cyclic. In the case each [typed text unclear]
g is f the limiting distributions have the value θ except
in one coset of H₁.

Let k be a limiting distribution. Let it be the limit of
the sequence Rᵣf gₛ, Rᵣf gⱼ, Rᵣf g... [handwritten: possibly R_f^(n) g…?]
then [some text about norms] … 
 ‖R_f^(n+1) g‖ / ‖R_fⁿ g‖  > [illegible] ...
Now ‖R_fⁿ g‖ / ‖k‖ → ...
tends to the limit 1 as n tends to infinity, and therefore
‖R_f^(n+1) g‖ / ‖R_fⁿ g‖ tends to 1. But ‖R_f u‖ / ‖u‖ [handwritten arrow
to "taking the limit"?] is a continuous function of u and therefore xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
limit of the sequence xxx ‖R_fᵏ / ‖k‖ = 1

Applyin g lemma (aΦ) to this we see th t there is a function
φₗ(4) , defined for all expressions of form a b⁻¹ where f(a) ≠ 0
f(b) ≠ 0 such th t  (φ(y x) : φ(y)(k x)) = [handwritten: small ‘×’?].
By applying the same argument with R_fⁿ in place of f we find that
there is a function φₙ(4) defined for all expressions
of form a₁ a₂ ... aₖ b⁻¹ bₖ⁻¹ ... b₁⁻¹  where f(a₁)f(a₂)...f(hₖ) ≠ 0
are all different from 0, such that  [handwritten math for “φ(xy) = φₙ(x)φₙ(y)...”].
Whenever φₙ(4) is defined. The various functions φₙ(4)
must agree wherever their domains or definition overlap, and
they may th erefore be all represented by one symbol φ. In
fact we may say that φ(x) is defined and has the value ×
whenever g(x):= α [unclear] . It now appears that the domain
of definition of φ(g) is a group, for if [handwritten: “φ(4, x) = α, φ(x) = …” etc.]

*(Handwritten insertions in blue ink revise or supplement the typed statements, often rewriting formulas for \(\|R_f^n g\|\) or \( \phi(xy) \). Several lines of typed text near the bottom are partly erased or overshadowed by notation. Where the typed text is fully obscured, I’ve used `[...]`.)*

### **Notes & Observations**:

1. **Title**: The typed title is “Th eorem III,” showing an extra space.  
2. **Subgroup Definition**: Turing references “a certain self‐conjugate subgroup \(H_1\)” and describes it as all expressions of a particular form with exponents summing to zero, implying a normal subgroup related to \(\sum m_i = 0\).  
3. **Norms & Limits**: The middle portion discusses sequences \(\|R_f^n g\|\), presumably iterating an operator \(R_f\) on a function or distribution \(g\). Turing examines how these norms behave as \(n \to \infty\).  
4. **Lemma (aΦ)**: The typed text references “lemma (aΦ)” or “lemma (aΦ) to this we see….” Possibly Turing’s in‐draft notation for a previously stated lemma.  
5. **Handwritten Notation**: Much of the page is heavily annotated in pen, especially rewriting or clarifying the functional equations \(\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)\) and how the domain of \(\phi\) overlaps with the support of \(f\).  
6. **Ellipses and question marks**: These indicate uncertain or missing text where the typed words are unreadable or partially covered by handwriting.  

All told, this is a **best‐effort** rendering of the visible typed and handwritten material.
