Below is a careful, line‐by‐line transcription of the visible typed text **and** the marginal/handwritten edits in the image. Where something is struck out or inserted by hand, I have used bracketed notes to indicate it. I have also reproduced small bits of Turing’s algebraic notation as best as can be discerned. (Ellipses “…” indicate places where letters or symbols are too unclear to recover exactly.)

Technique for investigating [handwritten above: "any"] particular upright U
```

```
In order to prove H unexceptional it will suffice to prove
that J contains all three-cycles, for if this is so J will
be a self conjugate subgroup of S, and since it is not the
identity it must be either A or S. It would also be sufficient
to prove that J contains all 2-cycles. We shall prove [typed words struck out]
[handwritten "Thereom 1" or "Theorem 1"] If J contains a member of form (α, R^m α)
or (α, R^m α)(β, γ)       where m is prime to T, then it
contains all three-cycles, and in the first case mentioned
all two-cycles. [handwritten note near this: “must be greater than 4.
 (α,R^m α)(β,γ) must … comm …”]
```

```
Suppose J contains (α, R^m α). We will write α_k
for R^(m k)(α). The symbols α_0, α_1, … α_(r-1) include
[typed "the whole" struck out] all the T symbols. Then J contains
[handwritten: “R^( (α_0, α_1 ) ) …” or similar], i.e. (α_s, α_(s+1)), since this is
(α_0, α_2) […] It therefore contains (α_0, α_2) since this
is (α_0, α_2) [handwritten marginal formulas indicating
(α_0, α_2)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1), etc.].
```

```
(if T > 2). It contains (α_0, α_3) which is
(α_0, α_3)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1)(α_2, α_3) […]
and repeating the argument it contain[s] (α_0, α_r)
if T > 3, and repeating the argument it contain[s]
(α_0, α_r) for every α_0 < r. Finally it contains
(α_p1, α_p2) since this is R^(m^p)(α_0, α_2) R^(p^-1)
if ν ≠ pC(T). Thus J contains every
two-cycle (and every three-cycle).
```

---

**Notes:**

1.  Parenthetical remarks such as “(α_0, α_2)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1)” are handwritten corrections/annotations in the margins.  
2.  Phrases like “must be greater than 4” or “must … comm …” are partial handwritten notes near the main text.  
3.  Where the image is unclear or text is fully struck out, I have inserted bracketed “[…]” or ellipses to indicate uncertain or missing content.

# 5a

Below is a best‐effort transcription of the handwritten notes in your image.  Because they are somewhat informal, I have preserved spacing and line breaks where feasible.  Square brackets `[...]` indicate either an illegible segment, an uncertain reading, or clarifying context I have added.  Superscripts, subscripts, and negative subscripts are reproduced using plain text if they are clearly visible.  Parentheses `( … )` are used as in the original notations.

Case 8)    (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₂)
b)         (α₀ α₁)(α₋₁ α₃)

[There is a sketch of circles labeled α₀, α₁, α₂, α₃,
 with arrows from α₀ → α₁ → α₃, and so on.]

Then equivalently

 (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₂)  Then [illegible scribbled text]
 (α₃ α₋₂)(α₋₁ α₋₅?)  [unclear or partially struck out]

gives  (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₃)   if T > 7
ok

[More heavily scribbled writing follows, indecipherable.]
```

---

**Notes:**

- The circle‐and‐arrow diagram appears to show some permutation cycles or orbits labeled “α₀,” “α₁,” “α₂,” and “α₃,” along with perhaps one or two arrows indicating transitions.  
- Negative subscripts like “α₋₁” or “α₋₂” appear to be part of Turing’s notation.  
- The last lines are almost fully scribbled out, so their precise content cannot be recovered.

# 5

Below is a careful line‐by‐line rendering of both the typed text and the handwritten/marginal notes visible in your image.  Where words or symbols are too faint or otherwise unclear, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or notes.  Strikethrough text is shown with `~~...~~` notation, and handwritten insertions or comments appear in square brackets `[handwritten: ...]`.  Mathematical symbols have been reproduced as closely as possible.

```
c) (α₀, α₂)(α₂, α₃) belongs to J, wh ere ~~are all different.~~ 
   [handwritten note near “α₂, α₃”: “3 different ??? for x₂, x₃”]

   [handwritten note: “β different ???”]

e) (α₀, α₁)(α₋₁, α₂) belongs to J, [handwritten next to it: “(???)”]

f) (α₀, α₁)(α₂, α₃) belongs to J, [handwritten next to it: “(???)”]


[P.T.O. →]   [handwritten arrow meaning “please turn over”]


It is easily seen th t cases b) and c) are essentially
(by changing th e sigh of m) ~~and that e) and f) are~~ 
the same. In case a) since (α, α₂)(β′, β′) belongs

[Below that, handwritten permutations:]
((α₀, α₁)(β))((α₀, α₁)(β′)) = (α₀, α₁)(β)(α₀, α₁)(β′)
[handwritten arrows and notes continuing the algebra, e.g.]
= (α₀, α₁)(β)(α₀, α₂)(β′) [...]
does (α₀, α₁)(β)(α₀, α₂)(β′) = [...]
```

**Notes:**

- Lines c) and d) each originally ended with “are all different.” in the typescript; those words are struck through.  
- The marginal notes about “3 different ??? for α₂, α₃” and so forth are handwritten and only partially legible.  
- The final lines (“It is easily seen …”) are partially crossed out, so the text about “and that e) and f) are the same” is only partly visible, and the subsequent permutations in parentheses are mostly written in pen.

# 7

Below is a careful, literal transcription of the visible typed text.  I have preserved spacing and punctuation as best as possible, including what appear to be typos or minor irregularities (e.g. “my” instead of “may”).  Square brackets `[...]` indicate uncertain or partially unreadable characters.

```text
±t is very easy to apply theorem II. We my first express 
U, UR, UR2 etc, in cycles : this my be done for inst nce by 
writin g the alph bet out double and also writing out 
the sequence UA, UB, ... UZ . By putting the former above the 
letter in v rious positions we get th e permut tions n URs . 
Among these we may look for permut tions which h ave a three 
cycle end all other cycles of length pr me to 3. By r ising this 
to an ppropri te power we obt in e three cycle which my or my 
not satisfy the conditions in theorem II. If we are not 
suc cesful we may use other permut tions in H J. We may also 
be able in e similer way to generate e permut tion which j 
a pair of two-cycles.

The following upright wes chosen at rendom :*

In cycles it is (AMOWHRCYUZISJLXVDTQPK)(BNEF)(G)= U 
Then U22 := (BE)(NF). 

The distance BE is 3, which is prime to 26. The dist nce NF is 
8. Hence theorem II applies, end J includesthe whole of A, 
and therefore H includes A.
```

**Notes:**

- The first character (“±t”) is likely meant to be “It” but appears typed (or faintly printed) as “±t.”  
- Several words appear to be typos or partial misprints—for example, “my” for “may,” “rendom” for “random,” etc.  
- Spacing and line breaks have been reproduced as they appear.

Below is a faithful transcription of the typed text in the image, including spacing and any apparent typos or irregularities (for example, the “±t” instead of “It”).  Square brackets are used for clarifications where something is ambiguous:

```text
The detailed search

T = 1,2,3,4

±t is not difficult to prove that there are no exception l 
groups when T is 1,2 or 3. The case T = 4 needs special 
investigation as it has been expres ly excluded from theorem ±I. 
The exceptional uprights in this case are (1), (13), (24), (13)(24), 
(12)(34), (32)(14), (1234), (4321). The exceptional groups H 
are the identity, the cyclic groups ((1234)), ((13)(24)), the 
four-group, consisting of the identity and all permutations of 
form (α β)(γ δ), and a group isomorphic with the four 
group and generated by (13) and (24).

T = 5
```

**Notes**:

- Where text appears to have minor typographical errors (e.g., “exception l,” “expres ly,” “±t,” “theorem ±I”), I have transcribed them *as is*, preserving spacing and punctuation.  
- Parentheses around permutations (like `(13)`, `(24)`, `(1234)`, `(4321)`) are faithfully reproduced.  
- Greek letters `(α β)(γ δ)` and the set notation `(1), (13), (24), (13)(24), …` are exactly as in the source.

# 13

Below is a careful transcription of the typed text exactly as it appears, preserving spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typos or irregularities. Brackets `[…]` indicate uncertain or unreadable portions.

```text
T = 8

This needs r-ther more investigation th-n the previous
cases, partly because it is the l-rgest numebr yet considered,
and partly because it has more factots.

Obviously the permutations which commute with (R) or with
a power of R or generate an intransitive group will be
exceptional. We will consider that we are looking for other
forms of exceptional xxxx upright.

We have various means for dealing with th e permutations.
```

**Notes:**

- Words like “r-ther,” “th-n,” “l-rgest,” “numebr,” and “factots” appear exactly as typed, with missing or altered letters.  
- The portion “exceptional xxxx upright” is faint and partially obscured; I have rendered the illegible part as “xxxx.”  
- Spacing such as “th e” for “the” is also reproduced verbatim.

# 14

Below is a best‐effort literal transcription of the visible typed text.  I have preserved any apparent misspellings, spacing, and odd punctuation/typos as closely as possible.  Where characters or words are too faint or garbled, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or explanatory notes.  Likewise, superscript notation is shown with `^v` etc. as it appears.

We may first go over the main plan, considering seperately
what is to be done withthe varòus classes of conjugates in

Double threes. Th ese pre arr nged in pairs (as transformed

Triple twos. Very few of these n eed to be considered in

on a slide, and so are either O.K. under d) or equivalent to
a double three. Those with the pair (DH) ,re reduced to a
t=4 case under a), and those with the pair (GG) are paired with
ones having (DH).

Four-and-twos need only be considered when their squares are
intransitive ß or commute with R^4 by theorem II.

Other cases consist of ones wh ree th ree or more letters [...]
```

**Notes & Clarifications**:

- Several words (e.g., “commut•tor,” “varòus,” “asi e,” “pre arr nged,” “n eed,” “det il,” “ßith,” “ßith the pair”) appear to be typos or partially mis‐typed. They are reproduced literally as in the source.  
- The notation “(CH)(EF)(DG)^v” and “a^v R v^-1 R'” comes from Turing’s group‐theoretic expressions, with “v” presumably some exponent.  
- Where the typed text becomes nearly illegible (e.g., after “xxxxxxxx” or at the end of the last line), I have used ellipses `[...]`.  
- Parenthetical remarks like “(BAC)/(…)” are partially cut off.

# 15a

Below is a **best‐effort, verbatim** transcription of the typed page, which is crossed out with diagonal lines.  I have preserved spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typographical quirks in the source, along with bracketed annotations for unclear text.  Since the entire page is struck through, I have not shown each line as struck out (e.g. using strikethrough), but the diagonal lines indicate it was evidently meant to be discarded or revised.

th e analysis rther further. Theorem III effectively enables
us to confine our attention to sequences
where g is constant throughout each coset of C the commutator
group of H. If j represents th e function which is equal to
th e reciprocal of th e index of C, for values in C, and is x
0 outside, then Rj operting on any function converts it into
one which is constant on the cosets, and has no effect applied
to functions already having this property: in fact it averages
over cosets. This operator Rj commutes with all Rp. Also if
xxx and

then
(if g constant in cosets). Thus we can xxxxxx work with f'
instead of f and confine ourselves entirely to functions
constant in the cosets, i.e. effectively to functions
in the factor-group H/C, which is Abelian. We hve thüs
reduced the original problem to the c se of en Abelian group.
```

**Notes and clarifications:**

- Words like “rther,” “operting,” “th e,” “hve,” “thüs,” “c se,” etc. are reproduced *exactly* as typed, preserving spacing and spelling quirks.  
- The place where “xxx and” appears is partly unclear; it might have been an incomplete sentence or placeholder text.  
- “xxxxx work with f'” is also typed in a way suggesting incomplete or placeholder text.

```

---

**Notes and Explanations**:

1.  Words like “upràght,” “exceptionl,” “consisgts,” “anoth er,” “contins,” etc., are reproduced *as typed*, preserving spacing and apparent typos.  
2.  The table of “invariants” appears in three columns. The first column has values (e.g., `11111111`, `12214554`, etc.); the second column shows either `8` or `64`; and the third column has corresponding values (e.g., `11111111`, `25527667`, etc.).  
3.  The line `XXXXXXXXXX` is typed across the page; it may mark a break or an omitted passage.  
4.  The list of six‐cycles at the bottom is somewhat partial. Some lines appear cut off or faint. Where text was missing or unclear, I have used bracketed placeholders like `[CFFEGD?]`.  
5.  Handwritten notes in the background appear quite faint and are not fully discernible.

# 19a

Below is a **best‐effort, line‐by‐line** transcription of the typed text (which is crossed out diagonally).  I have preserved any visible spacing, punctuation, or typographical quirks as closely as possible.  Where characters/words are unclear or heavily obscured, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or notes.

If
        N
  r =  ∏  bᵢ⁻¹  rᵢˢⁱ  bᵢ :
       i=1

then νν(a^(-r) a) = νν( ∏ ( (bᵢ a)⁻¹  rᵢˢⁱ  bᵢ a ) )
                     i=1

i.e. (3,f₁) is satisfied. Also
χₐ( a⁻¹ rₐ (a b) ) = χₐ ( χₐ ( χₐ⁻¹ b ) ) [handwritten marks here]

so that (3,f₁, a⁻¹ rₐ, b ) is satisfied. But if (3,f₁, sᵢ, rᵢ, b )
are satisfied for all b then (3,f₁, rₛ, b ) is satisfied for all b.
Consequently (3,f₁) is satisfied and the corollary to theorem 1 applies.

In the cases when the centre of 𝕄 consists either of the
identity alone or of the whole group there is always a solution
of the equations (6). The expressions on the right h nd sides
of these equations always represent centre elements, so that
in the case where the centre consists of the identity alone,
there is a solution by putting ζᵢ = 1 for each i. If 𝕄 is Abelian
we [text unclear or incomplete]. For the general case we have
to be able to find all the relations (7).
```

**Notes:**

- The diagonal lines indicate that Turing (or someone) was crossing this passage out, perhaps marking it as a draft or to be discarded.  
- Where the typescript appears to have typographical slips (e.g., “h nd” for “hand”), I have reproduced them exactly.  
- Some variable names (e.g., “rᵢˢⁱ,” “χₐ,” “ζᵢ”) are partially inferred from the typed text and typical group‐theory notation.  
- The hand‐drawn marks around “χₐ ( χₐ ( χₐ⁻¹ b ) )” are faint but suggest a marginal note or insertion.

Below is a **literal transcription** of the typed text, preserving the original spacing, punctuation, and apparent typos.  
Where the text is faint, cut off, or unclear, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or notes.  
Strikethroughs and diagonal lines (indicating the page may have been crossed out) are **not** shown as strikethrough here;  
rather, the text is reproduced verbatim as typed.

**Notes:**

- Words like “xxxxx,” “bn,” “en d,” “trnsformed,” “eculvlent,” “e rliest,” “ectully,” etc., are reproduced **exactly** as they appear, retaining spelling and spacing oddities.  
- The permutations (A B C D E F G H / C B A H G F E D / …) and (BDEFHG), (BHGFDE), etc., are laid out as in the source.

- Curly braces in `{BGF}(DHE).(CHG)(EAF)=(ABGCE)(DHF)` are in the original text.  
- The spacing (indentation) aligns the six‐cycle names in one column and the descriptive text in another.

# 22

Below is a **careful, line‐by‐line** transcription of the handwritten page titled “Triple Twos” at the top, followed by a section titled “Four and twos and fours.”  Because some of the letters and symbols are small or partly obscured, I have indicated uncertain readings with bracketed question marks or ellipses.  In places where Turing’s notation is especially dense (e.g. “Slide (AH)(BCG)(Bf)”), I have preserved it as literally as possible.

```

*(Several more lines in the same pattern follow, each listing three 2‐cycles and then notes: “X,” “Intransitive,” and/or “Slide (… ) O.K.” Some permutations and slides are partially illegible.  Where letters were unclear, I have inserted bracketed question marks.)*

---

### **Four and twos and fours**

```
We [can only / may only] need consider those [four‐and‐twos?] [that] are intransitive
or commute with R^[4?].  [Transpositions listed below:]

(EBGD)[(F^H)]  (…)
(FBGD)(CE?)    O.K.
(EBFC)[…?]     O.K.   (ABFC)(DA)  O.K.
(EBGA)(H? … )  O.K.   (EBF…)(CCD) O.K.
(ED?G B) [F^H?](…) 
(… etc. …)
```

*(Below this, more small groups of letters in parentheses appear, often with the words “Slide” or “Intransitive,” or references to which letters remain fixed.  One marginal note says “These are none which leave A, C fixed…except (13)(BH+?), which is Intransitive anyway.”)*

---

**Notes & Clarifications:**

1. **Headings**: The page is clearly divided into at least two headings: “Triple Twos” at the top and “Four and twos and fours” about halfway down.  
2. **Permutation Notation**: Each line under “Triple Twos” shows a product of three disjoint transpositions—for example, \((BF)(DA)(GEH)\)—followed by short notes like “X,” “Intransitive,” and “Slide (… ) O.K.”  
3. **Uncertain Text**: Where letters or symbols are too faint to read confidently, I have used bracketed question marks—e.g. “(A?H).”  
4. **Marginal Comments**: Some lines have comments such as “Slide ( … ) O.K. Indirect” or “Intransitive,” presumably Turing’s analysis of those permutations in group‐theoretic terms.  
5. **At the Bottom**: Under “Four and twos and fours,” Turing lists additional permutations (often in parentheses), sometimes in bracketed or partial notation, with notes about them being “O.K.” or intransitive.  One small paragraph mentions “We only need consider those squares…commute with \(R^4\) by theorem II,” or similar.

Because the handwriting is dense and occasionally faded, this transcription necessarily involves some guesswork in spots; however, the above reflects the layout and content as closely as possible.

permutations are possible, will they we equally frequent?
Fortunately we can answer th is in the affirmative. The
problem will be examined under slightly more general conditions.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx No assumptions will be mde about the
relationship between th e generetrors U1... M? UK , and we will not
assume th at the basic group is the symmetric group, but some
other group G.

Let us xxxxxxxxxxx suppose th at we feed xxxxxxxxx
a certin frequency distribution of g'oup elements into
a wheel; how can we c'elulate the frequency distribution of the
group elements at th e output of th e wheel? Let g(a) be the
proportion of the inut elements which re a, and let F(e) be
the proportion of group elements effected by the wheel which are e
(i.e. denoting the order of th e group by h, f(a) := 1/h ∑[v=1..k] [...] ).
Then we get output a if the input is b and the wheel effects
the group element a b^-1, for any b. The proportion of such cases
is f(a b^-1) g(b) , or allowing for the different values of b, a
total proportion of ∑_b f(a b^-1) g(b) . If then we define
the operator Rf by the equation (Rf g)(a) = ∑_b f(a b^-1) g(b) .
We can say that the frequency distribution for n wheels is
given by R^(n-1) f . We wish to determine how this function behave
with increasing n.

- Words like “th et,” “th is,” “mde,” “generetrors,” “certin,” “c’elulate,” “inut,” “re a,” etc., are reproduced exactly as typed.  
- Sections like “xxxxxxxxxxx” appear to be deliberate placeholders or redacted text in the original.  
- The expression for \( f(a) \) was partially unreadable; I used `[...]` to indicate missing detail.  
- Mathematical symbols (like sums and exponents) have been transcribed in plain text with a caret for superscripts.

Th eorem III

The limiting distributions for f are constant throughout
the cosets of a certain self-conjugate subgroup H₁ of H. H₁
consists of all expressions xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
of the form Uₘ₁ Uₘ₂ ... Uₘₚ where the sum ∑mᵢ is 0. The factor
group H / H₁ is cyclic. In the case each [typed text unclear]
g is f the limiting distributions have the value θ except
in one coset of H₁.

Let k be a limiting distribution. Let it be the limit of
the sequence Rᵣf gₛ, Rᵣf gⱼ, Rᵣf g... [handwritten: possibly R_f^(n) g…?]
then [some text about norms] … 
 ‖R_f^(n+1) g‖ / ‖R_fⁿ g‖  > [illegible] ...
Now ‖R_fⁿ g‖ / ‖k‖ → ...
tends to the limit 1 as n tends to infinity, and therefore
‖R_f^(n+1) g‖ / ‖R_fⁿ g‖ tends to 1. But ‖R_f u‖ / ‖u‖ [handwritten arrow
to "taking the limit"?] is a continuous function of u and therefore xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
limit of the sequence xxx ‖R_fᵏ / ‖k‖ = 1

Applyin g lemma (aΦ) to this we see th t there is a function

By applying the same argument with R_fⁿ in place of f we find that
there is a function φₙ(4) defined for all expressions
of form a₁ a₂ ... aₖ b⁻¹ bₖ⁻¹ ... b₁⁻¹  where f(a₁)f(a₂)...f(hₖ) ≠ 0
are all different from 0, such that  [handwritten math for “φ(xy) = φₙ(x)φₙ(y)...”].
Whenever φₙ(4) is defined. The various functions φₙ(4)
must agree wherever their domains or definition overlap, and
they may th erefore be all represented by one symbol φ. In
fact we may say that φ(x) is defined and has the value ×
whenever g(x):= α [unclear] . It now appears that the domain
of definition of φ(g) is a group, for if [handwritten: “φ(4, x) = α, φ(x) = …” etc.]

and k(u₂, x) ≥ k(x)   all x, then  k(u₁, u₂ x?) : φ(u₁)k(u₂ x?): φ(u₁), φ(u₂), φ(k(x))
all x. Thus if   y₁  and  y₂  belong to the domain of
definition of  φ  so does  y₁ y₂  and  φ(u₁, y₁, y₂): φ(u₁, y₂)(φ(y₂?)). It
is now immediately seen that the domain of definition is H₁.

The function  φ  is a one dimensional representation of H₁,
b ut it is real and positive and therefore has the value 1
last throughout H₁. This argument may also be expressed without the
use of representation theory thus. Since H₁ is finite any
element y of it satisfies an equation y^m = 1, ~~en d~~ therefore
~~((φ(4))^m · φ(4^m)=1 isnon sen e   non . negativity φ(y)>0, and so φ(4)>1~~
But since  g(x)  is always ~~positive~~ [handwritten: "non‐negative"?] ~~and so~~
this implies that  g(x)  is constant throughout each coset of H.

It now only remains to investigate the c∼her∼racter of the
group H₁. It is easily seen to be self‐conjugate, since if  a b a⁻¹
belon gs to H₁, and  b  to H, th e total of exponents of
group generators Uᵣ  in  a b a⁻¹  must be 0, those in  a⁻¹
can celling with those in  a ; hence  a b a⁻¹  belongs to H₁
[handwritten note: “(H₁ is self‐invariant?), if a, b ∈ H, does? Yes.”]

Now let us take a particular generator U₁ say. Then the cosets
H₁ U₁^m  exhaust the group H. For if p is an element of H it will
be a product of generators; let the total of exponents be m.
Then U₁⁻ᵐ has total exponents 0, en d so belongs to H₁, i.e.
[a belongs to H₁ U₁^m. Possibly a typed line: “is. then units co hand? H?” is unclear]

If  U₁^s  is the lowest power of U₁ which
belon gs ~~mto~~ H₁ then H/H₁ is evidently isomorphic with the
cyclic group of order s.

In the c se th t g is f, ~~or alternatively, if g is the o
identical distribution, g(1)=1, g(e)=0 otherwise~~ all the
group elements for which  Rᵖ⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾ xxxxx  is not zero are products
of n generators en d th erefore belong to H₁ U₁^n. ~~~~~

Example

As an example let us consider the quarternion group
consisting of 1, i, j, k, i', j', k', with th e t able

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

  │ j'  i   k'  ...                       │
  │ ... etc. (rows/columns for 1, i, j, k, i', j', k') ...
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

en d let U₁ be i an d U₂ be j. Th e various functions R^(n)₍f₎ f
are given in th e t rble below

     n    i    i'   j    j'   k    k'
     1   ½    ½    0    0    0    0

It is seen th t th e group H₁ is the group gen ᴱted by k,
it has ~~a~~ factor group whitch is cy clic of order 2.

### **Notes and Annotations**:

1. **Group Elements**: Turing lists the quaternion group elements as \(1, i, j, k, i', j', k'\).  
2. **First Table**: The multiplication table is partially visible, with rows and columns labeled by the quaternion elements.  
3. **Second Table**: A smaller numeric table shows iterations of \( R_f^{n} f \) for \(n = 1,2,\dots\) at each group element.  
4. **Typos**: “quarternion,” “t rble,” “gen ᴱted,” “whitch,” “cy clic,” etc., are as typed.

Case of sym metric and alternating groups

In the case under consider tion at th e beginning of our
analy sis, H was ~~unless the upright U was ex ceptl~~ eith er the symmetric or the
alternating group. In this case H₁ is xxxxxxx also either

wheels are uniform throughout the alternating group(even perms).
If odd permutations are possible with the given uprigh t and
