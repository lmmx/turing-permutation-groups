Below is a careful, literal transcription of the visible typed text.  I have preserved spacing and punctuation as best as possible, including what appear to be typos or minor irregularities (e.g. “my” instead of “may”).  Square brackets `[...]` indicate uncertain or partially unreadable characters.

±t is very easy to apply theorem II. We my first express 
U, UR, UR2 etc, in cycles : this my be done for inst nce by 
writin g the alph bet out double and also writing out 
the sequence UA, UB, ... UZ . By putting the former above the 
letter in v rious positions we get th e permut tions n URs . 
Among these we may look for permut tions which h ave a three 
cycle end all other cycles of length pr me to 3. By r ising this 
to an ppropri te power we obt in e three cycle which my or my 
not satisfy the conditions in theorem II. If we are not 
suc cesful we may use other permut tions in H J. We may also 
be able in e similer way to generate e permut tion which j 
a pair of two-cycles.

The following upright wes chosen at rendom :* 

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
MNYTFBGRSLAKOEWKPCJQZDHVUI

In cycles it is (AMOWHRCYUZISJLXVDTQPK)(BNEF)(G)= U 
Then U22 := (BE)(NF). 

The distance BE is 3, which is prime to 26. The dist nce NF is 
8. Hence theorem II applies, end J includesthe whole of A, 
and therefore H includes A.

**Notes:**

- The first character (“±t”) is likely meant to be “It” but appears typed (or faintly printed) as “±t.”  
- Several words appear to be typos or partial misprints—for example, “my” for “may,” “rendom” for “random,” etc.  
- Spacing and line breaks have been reproduced as they appear.
