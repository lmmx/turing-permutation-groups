Below is a paragraph‐by‐paragraph summary of the text exactly as it appears in the typescript you provided (excluding LaTeX commands and page‐number references). Each paragraph is numbered in the order it appears in your quoted source. The summary focuses on what each paragraph states or does, without adding broader context or motives beyond the text itself.

---

### Paragraph 1
> **Text**:  
> "\noindent {\bf [Editor’s note]}: The beginning of Turing’s typescript, including the original title, is missing. …"

- **Summary**:  
  In this editorial note, the missing beginning of Turing’s typescript is mentioned. The editor clarifies that the title “On Permutation Groups” was suggested by R. O. Gandy, since Turing’s original title is lost.

---

### Paragraph 2
> **Text**:  
> "\noindent \textellipsis{} form \(U_{n1} U_{n2} \dots U_{nN}\). …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing remarks that the parity of the permutation formed by \(U_{n1} U_{n2} \dots U_{nN}\) is tied to the power of \(U\). He then states that, instead of examining permutations produced by a single machine, he will consider permutations obtainable from a fixed “upright” \(U\) and any number of wheels.

---

### Paragraph 3
> **Text**:  
> "Let \(H(U)\) or \(H\) be the set of permutations … hence \(H\) is a group."

- **Summary**:  
  Turing introduces \(H(U)\) (or simply \(H\)) as the set of all permutations one can get from a given upright \(U\). He explains why \(H\) is a group: namely, it is closed under composition (e.g., placing two machines in series). He also notes it is finite because it is contained in a finite symmetric group.

---

### Paragraph 4
> **Text**:  
> "Since \(H\) is finite and contained in the symmetric group, … \(H\) may be expressed …"

- **Summary**:  
  He shows how \(H\) can be generated by certain elements and how it relates to the group \(J(U)\). Specifically, \(J(U)\) is generated by \(U\) and \(R\), while \(H\) is generated by all the “wheel positions” of \(U\). Turing explains that \(H\) differs from \(J\) only by the sum‐of‐exponents restriction and that \(H\) is a normal (self‐conjugate) subgroup of \(J\) with index at most \(T\).

---

### Paragraph 5
> **Text**:  
> "We shall say that \(H\) or \(H(U)\) is {\em exceptional} if …"

- **Summary**:  
  The concept of an “exceptional” group is introduced. \(H\) (arising from \(U\)) is called exceptional if it does **not** include the entire alternating group \(A\). If \(H\) is not exceptional, it must be either \(A\) itself or the full symmetric group \(S\). Turing labels these “unexceptional.”

---

### Paragraph 6
> **Text**:  
> "We shall actually investigate \(J\) rather than \(H\). \(J\) is obviously easier …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing states his intention to focus on \(J\) (the group generated by \(U\) and \(R\)) because it is simpler to handle. He then presents the idea that the unexceptionality of \(H\) depends on whether \(J\) is also unexceptional.

---

### Paragraph 7 (Theorem I statement)
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Theorem I.} {\em The necessary and sufficient condition for \(H\) to … }"

- **Summary**:  
  This paragraph contains Theorem I: if \(U \neq 1\) and \(T \neq 4\), then \(H\) is unexceptional if and only if \(J\) is unexceptional. Turing sketches the logic that if \(J\) is unexceptional (i.e., equals \(A\) or \(S\)), the only normal subgroups are trivial or the whole group, implying \(H\) must be \(A\) or \(S\), hence unexceptional.

---

### Paragraph 8
> **Text**:  
> "We have shown that \(H\) is a self‐conjugate subgroup …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing provides more details on why \(H\) must coincide with \(A\) or \(S\) if \(J\) is \(A\) or \(S\). He excludes trivial possibilities by assuming \(U \neq 1\). Conversely, if \(H\) is unexceptional, then \(J\) inherits that property by containing \(H\).

---

### Paragraph 9
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Technique for investigating any particular upright \(U\")} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing gives an overview of his technique to determine whether \(H\) (and thus \(J\)) is unexceptional for a specific upright \(U\). He notes that showing \(J\) contains all 3‐cycles (or all 2‐cycles) is enough to conclude \(J\) is \(A\) or \(S\). This idea sets up Theorem II.

---

### Paragraph 10 (Theorem II statement)
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Theorem II.} {\em If \(J\) contains a member of the form \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\) …}"

- **Summary**:  
  This paragraph states Theorem II in full. It lists three specific forms of permutations in \(J\) (e.g., \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\), \((\alpha, R^m \alpha, \beta)\), \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)(\beta, \gamma)\)) that, if found, guarantee \(J\) contains all 3‐cycles (and sometimes all 2‐cycles). The theorem also has conditions on \(m\) (prime to \(T\)) and non‐commutation with \(R^{T/2}\).

---

### Paragraph 11
> **Text**:  
> "Suppose \(J\) contains \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\). We will write \(\alpha_k\) for …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing demonstrates the argument behind Theorem II’s first case: once \(J\) contains a transposition of the form \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\), one can generate all transpositions \((\alpha_p, \alpha_q)\) through conjugation and combination, hence the entire set of 2‐cycles (and thus 3‐cycles).

---

### Paragraph 12
> **Text**:  
> "Now suppose \(J\) contains \((\alpha, R^m \alpha, \beta)\) …"

- **Summary**:  
  He turns to the second form in Theorem II, involving a 3‐cycle \((\alpha, R^m \alpha, \beta)\). He shows how to adjust exponents and manipulate these cycles so that ultimately one gets a 3‐cycle \((\alpha, R^{m'} \alpha, R^{2m'} \alpha)\) with \(m'\) prime to \(T\). This leads to all 3‐cycles.

---

### Paragraph 13
> **Text**:  
> "Finally, if \(J\) contains \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)(\beta, \gamma)\) …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing addresses the third form: a product of two 2‐cycles \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)(\beta, \gamma)\). Under the condition that it does not commute with \(R^{T/2}\) (when \(T\) is even) and that \(m\) is prime to \(T\), one can derive a 3‐cycle (or 2‐cycle) within \(J\). Hence the group must again be large (either \(A\) or \(S\)).

---

### Paragraph 14
> **Text**:  
> "Thus Theorem~II tells us that finding any permutation in \(J\) …"

- **Summary**:  
  Concluding the discussion of Theorem II, Turing explains that if any permutation of those listed types appears in \(J\), then \(J\) automatically contains all transpositions or 3‐cycles. In the rare situation that none of those forms appear, one is in the “exceptional” situation.

---

### Paragraph 15
> **Text**:  
> "It is very easy to apply Theorem~II. We may first express \(U, UR, UR^2, \dots\) in cycles; …"

- **Summary**:  
  Offers a practical method for applying Theorem II to real examples: writing out all cycle forms of \(U R^s\) and checking for the presence of 2‐ or 3‐cycles. Turing explains how to manipulate these permutations by powers and how to detect pairs of 2‐cycles.

---

### Paragraph 16
> **Text**:  
> "{\em Example.} The following upright was chosen at random: …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing provides a concrete example with a 26‐letter alphabet. He writes down the permutation \(U\) in cycle notation and finds that \((BE)(NF)\) arises as a power of \(U\). Because the distances in that 2‐cycle are relatively prime to 26, Theorem II applies, and the group \(J\) then includes all even permutations.

---

### Paragraph 17
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Systematic search for exceptional groups. Theory} …"

- **Summary**:  
  This paragraph shifts to a broader method for identifying all “exceptional” cases for a given \(T\). Turing notes that many uprights can be grouped together if they produce isomorphic groups or the same group \(H\). He lists main principles for classifying and reducing uprights: multiplying by powers of \(R\), conjugation by commutative permutations, etc.

---

### Paragraph 18
> **Text**:  
> "The principle (i) is the one of which we make the most systematic use. …"

- **Summary**:  
  Explains more thoroughly how principle (i), \(U' = R^{m'} U R^n\), is used to generate equivalent representations of the same group. Turing points out that the biggest challenge is handling \(U\) with or without a “beetle” (i.e., a permutation that fixes two letters).

---

### Paragraph 19
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf \(U\) with no beetle} …"

- **Summary**:  
  This segment describes how one can classify uprights that never fix two letters. Turing introduces a numeric “invariant” derived from writing down the permutation and shifting sequences of differences. He notes that the invariant must respect conditions that eliminate most cases for even \(T\). Thus, such upright permutations without beetles are rare or trivial (often just powers of \(R\)).

---

### Paragraph 20
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf \(U\) with a beetle} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Focuses on the case where some \(R^m U R^n\) fixes two letters. Turing describes a standardized approach to simplifying the permutation so that one of the fixed letters can be taken as \(A\). He also discusses how other symmetries can reduce the number of cases to check.

---

### Paragraph 21
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf The detailed search} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Introduces Turing’s systematic procedure for enumerating and testing possible uprights according to specific values of \(T\). He summarizes results for small \(T\).  

---

### Paragraph 22
> **Text**:  
> "{\em \(T = 1, 2, 3, 4\).} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Explains that for \(T=1,2,3\), no exceptional groups arise. For \(T=4\), there **are** exceptional cases, listed explicitly: certain permutations like \((13)(24)\), \((1234)\), etc. The paragraph identifies these small groups: the identity, certain cyclic groups, and a 4‐group.

---

### Paragraph 23
> **Text**:  
> "{\em \(T = 5\).} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Notes that for \(T=5\), the analysis is simpler. Almost all permutations are unexceptional except some that belong to the “numatizer” of \((R)\). This yields exactly 20 exceptional uprights.

---

### Paragraph 24
> **Text**:  
> "{\em \(T = 6\).} …"

- **Summary**:  
  States that for \(T=6\), one only needs to consider permutations fixing two letters. The only ways to be exceptional are by being intransitive or commuting with \(R^3\). Turing counts 78 total exceptional cases out of 720.

---

### Paragraph 25
> **Text**:  
> "{\em \(T = 7\).} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Analyzes \(T=7\). The “no beetle” type is either the numatizer of \((R)\) or a specific invariant. He concludes these yield an unexceptional group except for certain well‐known symmetrical subgroups (like the 7‐point geometry symmetry group). The final count is 336 exceptional uprights. He lists invariants associated with that geometry group and the numatizer.

---

### Paragraph 26
> **Text**:  
> "{\em \(T = 8\).} …"

- **Summary**:  
  A longer section on \(T=8\). Turing systematically checks each cycle structure (6‐cycles, double 3‐cycles, triple 2‐cycles, etc.) for potential commutation with \(R^4\), intransitivity, or membership in special subgroup families \(K\) and \(K'\). He concludes that all exceptional uprights for \(T=8\) are either intransitive, commute with \(R^4\), or lie in the two special groups \(K, K'\). He also calculates how many such exceptional uprights there are (2144 out of 40320).

---

### Paragraph 27
> **Text**:  
> "It is very easy to apply Theorem~II. We may first express \(U, UR, UR^2, \dots\) in cycles; …"

- **Summary**:  
  (Note that this paragraph is repeated verbatim in the source or is it an editorial duplication? In any event, Turing reiterates the simpler cycle‐examination approach. Possibly this is where the typescript transitions back to discuss the next topic. The text emphasizes how to do the cycle expansions to test for 3‐cycles or 2‐cycles, linking it back to the “invariant” approach.)

---

### Paragraph 28
> **Text**:  
> "We now turn to a rather different topic in connection with the use …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing changes the subject to frequency distributions of permutations when multiple wheels are used. He wants to see if all permutations occur equally often under repeated application of certain group elements.

---

### Paragraph 29
> **Text**:  
> "Let us suppose that we feed a certain frequency distribution … how can we calculate …"

- **Summary**:  
  Explains how an operator \(R_f\) acts on a frequency distribution of group elements. The proportion \(f(a)\) of times a wheel generates element \(a\) influences the resulting distribution after it is applied. Turing defines \( (R_f g)(a) \) as the sum over products \(f(ab^{-1})\,g(b)\).

---

### Paragraph 30
> **Text**:  
> "We consider the real‐valued functions on the group …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing sets up an inner product and a norm on these frequency‐function spaces, referencing Schwarz’s inequality to bound changes in distributions. He also introduces the average (mean) value \(\overline{g}\).

---

### Paragraph 31 (Lemma (a))
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Lemma (a).} {\em If \(\overline{f}=1,\) then …}"

- **Summary**:  
  States the key lemma about \(\|R_f g\|\le \|g\|\). It shows equality holds only if a certain ratio of function values is independent of \(x\). Turing proves this by applying a Cauchy–Schwarz style argument.

---

### Paragraph 32
> **Text**:  
> "Let us define the {\em limiting distribution} for \(f\) as the condensation points …"

- **Summary**:  
  Introduces the idea of a limiting distribution under repeated application of \(R_f\). Turing sets up Theorem III, which describes the final behavior of frequencies after many wheels.

---

### Paragraph 33 (Theorem III statement)
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Theorem III.} {\em The necessary and sufficient condition …}"

- **Summary**:  
  Presents Theorem III on limiting distributions. It states that the limiting distributions are constant on cosets of a certain normal (self‐conjugate) subgroup \(H_1\). When \(H_1\) is trivial or large, this implies uniform distributions across even or all permutations in the symmetric/alternating case.

---

### Paragraph 34
> **Text**:  
> "Let \(k\) be a limiting distribution. Let it be the limit …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing walks through the proof of Theorem III. He uses the iterative norm properties and then shows that there must be a function \(\varphi\) turning out to be a one‐dimensional representation. This proves \(k\) must be constant on cosets of the subgroup.

---

### Paragraph 35
> **Text**:  
> "It is now immediately seen that the domain of definition is \(H_1\). …"

- **Summary**:  
  Concludes that \(\varphi(y)\) has to be 1 for all \(y\) in that subgroup \(H_1\), because the group is finite and \(\varphi(y)\ge 0\). This forces \(k\) to be constant across each coset.

---

### Paragraph 36
> **Text**:  
> "It now only remains to investigate the character of the group \(H_1\). …"

- **Summary**:  
  Argues that \(H_1\) is self‐conjugate and its factor group \(H/H_1\) is cyclic. Hence if one generator belongs to \(H_1\) for some power, the entire group has a cyclic quotient.

---

### Paragraph 37
> **Text**:  
> "{\em Example.} As an example let us consider the quaternion group …"

- **Summary**:  
  Turing illustrates Theorem III with a small non‐commutative group example (the quaternion group). He constructs a table of frequencies under repeated application of \(R_f\) to show how the distribution cycles or converges. He shows how \(H_1\) is generated by \(k\), yielding a factor group of order 2.

---

### Paragraph 38
> **Text**:  
> "{\bf Case of symmetric and alternating groups} …"

- **Summary**:  
  Finally, Turing applies the preceding analysis to the symmetric or alternating group case. Because \(H_1\) is normal and must itself be either \(A\) or \(S\), the limiting distributions for large numbers of wheels become uniform across the entire group or across all even permutations, depending on parity. He concludes that if an upright is not exceptional, the distribution across permutations is ultimately uniform.

---

### Paragraph 39
> **Text**:  
> "(End of typescript as preserved) …"

- **Summary**:  
  The text ends. This line simply marks the end of the surviving manuscript.
