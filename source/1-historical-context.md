Although Turing’s notes themselves do not explicitly state their purpose, one can infer from his broader work that analyzing permutations and subgroup sizes was highly relevant to **cryptanalysis** and the design or evaluation of **rotor‐based cipher machines**. During the Second World War, Turing was deeply involved in understanding and breaking the Enigma and other ciphers; part of that effort required examining how a set of “rotors” (each effecting a permutation) could combine to generate large or small subsets of all possible letter transformations. If the combined permutations (the “uprights,” in Turing’s terminology) produced only a **small** or predictable subset—an “exceptional” scenario—the cipher might be more vulnerable. Conversely, if they generated **nearly all permutations**, it would be much harder to attack. Turing’s iterative “wheel” operator, analyzing whether repeated applications converge to a uniform distribution, can be seen as a measure of how thoroughly the rotor settings “mix” the message space. Thus, the cycle‐centric proofs and subgroup‐analysis would have been of practical interest in testing or refining cipher systems, ensuring they did not accidentally restrict themselves to a small subset of permutations that enemies could exploit.
