Case of sym metric and alternating groups

In the case under consider tion at th e beginning of our
analy sis, H was ~~unless the upright U was ex ceptl~~ eith er the symmetric or the
alternating group. In this case H₁ is xxxxxxx also either
the symmetric or th e altern ting group, for it is self
conjugate in H. It will b e the xxxxxxx group if the
generators are all of th e s me r rity, and the symmetric group
otherwise.

We th erefore conclude th t when th e uprigh t is not
exception al th e distributions with large numbers of
wheels are uniform throughout the alternating group(even perms).
If odd permutations are possible with the given uprigh t and
number of wheels th e distribution is uniform th roughout
th e symmetric group (all perms).

**Notes**:

1. Words like “sym metric,” “consider tion,” “altern ting,” “analy sis,” “th e,” “uprigh t,” and “exception al” are reproduced *exactly* as typed, preserving spacing and apparent typos.  
2. The stricken text “~~unless the upright U was ex ceptl~~” is typed but then crossed out.  
3. The placeholder “xxxxxxx” appears to redact or omit some typed phrase.  
4. Parenthetical phrases like “(even perms)” and “(all perms)” are typed exactly as shown in the image.
