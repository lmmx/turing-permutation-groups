Below is a best‐effort literal transcription of the visible typed text.  I have preserved any apparent misspellings, spacing, and odd punctuation/typos as closely as possible.  Where characters or words are too faint or garbled, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or explanatory notes.  Likewise, superscript notation is shown with `^v` etc. as it appears.

This is indicated by the v lue of the commut•tor and ixxx 'O.K.'

We may first go over the main plan, considering seperately
what is to be done withthe varòus classes of conjugates in
the symmetric group.

666cycles. These are left asi e till the double threes
have bèen conidered.

Double threes. Th ese pre arr nged in pairs (as transformed
by (CH)(EF)(DG)^v) which leaves A,B fixed and xxxxxxxx
satisfies a^v R v^-1 R') and dealt with in detail.

Triple twos. Very few of these n eed to be considered in
det il. Those ßith the pair (CH) give (BAC)/(...) ßith other cycles
on a slide, and so are either O.K. under d) or equivalent to
a double three. Those with the pair (DH) ,re reduced to a
t=4 case under a), and those with the pair (GG) are paired with
ones having (DH).

Four-and-twos need only be considered when their squares are
intransitive ß or commute with R^4 by theorem II.

Other cases consist of ones wh ree th ree or more letters [...]

**Notes & Clarifications**:

- Several words (e.g., “commut•tor,” “varòus,” “asi e,” “pre arr nged,” “n eed,” “det il,” “ßith,” “ßith the pair”) appear to be typos or partially mis‐typed. They are reproduced literally as in the source.  
- The notation “(CH)(EF)(DG)^v” and “a^v R v^-1 R'” comes from Turing’s group‐theoretic expressions, with “v” presumably some exponent.  
- Where the typed text becomes nearly illegible (e.g., after “xxxxxxxx” or at the end of the last line), I have used ellipses `[...]`.  
- Parenthetical remarks like “(BAC)/(…)” are partially cut off.
