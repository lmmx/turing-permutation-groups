Below is a **verbatim transcription** of the typed text on the page, followed by a description of the two hand‐drawn tables (the quaternion multiplication table and the small numerical table).  I have preserved spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typos as closely as possible.  Where characters are partially obscured or unreadable, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]`.

Example

As an example let us consider the quarternion group
consisting of 1, i, j, k, i', j', k', with th e t able

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │   i   j   k   i'  j'  k'              │
  │ i'  k'  j'  i   k   j  ...            │
  │ k'  j   i'  ...                       │
  │ j'  i   k'  ...                       │
  │ ... etc. (rows/columns for 1, i, j, k, i', j', k') ...
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

en d let U₁ be i an d U₂ be j. Th e various functions R^(n)₍f₎ f
are given in th e t rble below

     n    i    i'   j    j'   k    k'
     1   ½    ½    0    0    0    0
     2   0   0   ¼  ½   0   ¼
     3   0   1/₄  0   1/₄  0  ...
     4   ...
     5   ...
     6   ...

It is seen th t th e group H₁ is the group gen ᴱted by k,
it has ~~a~~ factor group whitch is cy clic of order 2.

### **Notes and Annotations**:

1. **Group Elements**: Turing lists the quaternion group elements as \(1, i, j, k, i', j', k'\).  In his notation, “\(x'\)” presumably denotes \(-x\).  The standard quaternion group has eight elements \(\{\pm1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}\); Turing’s notation omits the minus sign and instead uses a prime \(x'\).  
2. **First Table**: The top, larger table (the “multiplication table”) is partially visible.  Rows and columns correspond to \(1, i, j, k, i', j', k'\).  The interior cells show the product of the row element with the column element.  Only part of that grid is shown in the image.  
3. **Second Table**: Below that is a smaller numeric table labeled with heading row “\(n, i, i', j, j', k, k'\).”  The rows \(n=1,2,\dots\) show numeric values (e.g. “½, ½, 0, 0, 0, 0” for \(n=1\)).  These are presumably the values of some iterated function \(R_f^{n}f\) evaluated at each group element.  
4. **Typos**: The words “quarternion,” “th e t able,” “gen ᴱted,” and “whitch” are reproduced verbatim.  Where typed letters are faint or overwritten, the best guess is shown.  
5. **References**: Turing’s note “and let \(U_1\) be i and \(U_2\) be j” suggests these two elements generate part (or all) of the group.  He then examines the resulting distributions (rows 1–6 in the second table).
