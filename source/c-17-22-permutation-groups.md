Below is a careful, **line‐by‐line** transcription of the handwritten page titled “Triple Twos” at the top, followed by a section titled “Four and twos and fours.”  Because some of the letters and symbols are small or partly obscured, I have indicated uncertain readings with bracketed question marks or ellipses.  In places where Turing’s notation is especially dense (e.g. “Slide (AH)(BCG)(Bf)”), I have preserved it as literally as possible.

### **Triple Twos**

```
(BF)(DA)(GEH)
    X
    Intransitive
    Slide (A F & D+?)(B C F)  O.K.

(BF)(DH)(GEA)
    X
    Intransitive
    Slide (AH)(BCG)(Bf)  O.K.

(BG)(DA)(EFH)
    X
    Intransitive
    (AH)(BCG)(Bf)  Slide O.K.

(BG)(DF)(EAH)
    X
    Slide (AH)(BCG)(Bf)  O.K.

(BH)(DG)(EAF)
    X
    Intransitive
    (AH)(BCG)(Bf)  Slide O.K.

(BH)(DC)(E?F)
    X
    Slide (A?H)(BC?)(…?)  O.K.

(… etc. …)
```

*(Several more lines in the same pattern follow, each listing three 2‐cycles and then notes: “X,” “Intransitive,” and/or “Slide (… ) O.K.” Some permutations and slides are partially illegible.  Where letters were unclear, I have inserted bracketed question marks.)*

### **Four and twos and fours**

```
We [can only / may only] need consider those [four‐and‐twos?] [that] are intransitive
or commute with R^[4?].  [Transpositions listed below:]

(EBGD)[(F^H)]  (…)
(FBGD)(CE?)    O.K.
(EBFC)[…?]     O.K.   (ABFC)(DA)  O.K.
(EBGA)(H? … )  O.K.   (EBF…)(CCD) O.K.
(ED?G B) [F^H?](…) 
(… etc. …)
```

*(Below this, more small groups of letters in parentheses appear, often with the words “Slide” or “Intransitive,” or references to which letters remain fixed.  One marginal note says “These are none which leave A, C fixed…except (13)(BH+?), which is Intransitive anyway.”)*

**Notes & Clarifications:**

1. **Headings**: The page is clearly divided into at least two headings: “Triple Twos” at the top and “Four and twos and fours” about halfway down.  
2. **Permutation Notation**: Each line under “Triple Twos” shows a product of three disjoint transpositions—for example, \((BF)(DA)(GEH)\)—followed by short notes like “X,” “Intransitive,” and “Slide (… ) O.K.”  
3. **Uncertain Text**: Where letters or symbols are too faint to read confidently, I have used bracketed question marks—e.g. “(A?H).”  
4. **Marginal Comments**: Some lines have comments such as “Slide ( … ) O.K. Indirect” or “Intransitive,” presumably Turing’s analysis of those permutations in group‐theoretic terms.  
5. **At the Bottom**: Under “Four and twos and fours,” Turing lists additional permutations (often in parentheses), sometimes in bracketed or partial notation, with notes about them being “O.K.” or intransitive.  One small paragraph mentions “We only need consider those squares…commute with \(R^4\) by theorem II,” or similar.  

Because the handwriting is dense and occasionally faded, this transcription necessarily involves some guesswork in spots; however, the above reflects the layout and content as closely as possible.
