Below is a **best‐effort, line‐by‐line** transcription of the typed text (which is crossed out diagonally).  I have preserved any visible spacing, punctuation, or typographical quirks as closely as possible.  Where characters/words are unclear or heavily obscured, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or notes.

If
        N
  r =  ∏  bᵢ⁻¹  rᵢˢⁱ  bᵢ :
       i=1

then νν(a^(-r) a) = νν( ∏ ( (bᵢ a)⁻¹  rᵢˢⁱ  bᵢ a ) )
                     i=1

i.e. (3,f₁) is satisfied. Also
χₐ( a⁻¹ rₐ (a b) ) = χₐ ( χₐ ( χₐ⁻¹ b ) ) [handwritten marks here]

so that (3,f₁, a⁻¹ rₐ, b ) is satisfied. But if (3,f₁, sᵢ, rᵢ, b )
are satisfied for all b then (3,f₁, rₛ, b ) is satisfied for all b.
Consequently (3,f₁) is satisfied and the corollary to theorem 1 applies.

In the cases when the centre of 𝕄 consists either of the
identity alone or of the whole group there is always a solution
of the equations (6). The expressions on the right h nd sides
of these equations always represent centre elements, so that
in the case where the centre consists of the identity alone,
there is a solution by putting ζᵢ = 1 for each i. If 𝕄 is Abelian
we [text unclear or incomplete]. For the general case we have
to be able to find all the relations (7).

**Notes:**

- The diagonal lines indicate that Turing (or someone) was crossing this passage out, perhaps marking it as a draft or to be discarded.  
- Where the typescript appears to have typographical slips (e.g., “h nd” for “hand”), I have reproduced them exactly.  
- Some variable names (e.g., “rᵢˢⁱ,” “χₐ,” “ζᵢ”) are partially inferred from the typed text and typical group‐theory notation.  
- The hand‐drawn marks around “χₐ ( χₐ ( χₐ⁻¹ b ) )” are faint but suggest a marginal note or insertion.
