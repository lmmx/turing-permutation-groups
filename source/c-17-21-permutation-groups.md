Below is a **verbatim** transcription of the typed text, with spacing and any apparent typos or irregularities preserved.  
I have reproduced the list format (each line starting with a six‐cycle in parentheses) as best as possible in plain text.  
Brackets `[ … ]` indicate places where the text was faint or partially cut off.

**Notes and Observations**:

- Several words appear mistyped: “Invrint” for “Invariant,” “givin g” for “giving,” “ve’tigte” for “investigate,” etc.  
- Some lines seem to repeat or partially duplicate, such as `(BDFHGE)     SLIDE (BAEH)(DCF) O.K.` appearing twice.  
- Curly braces in `{BGF}(DHE).(CHG)(EAF)=(ABGCE)(DHF)` are in the original text.  
- The spacing (indentation) aligns the six‐cycle names in one column and the descriptive text in another.
