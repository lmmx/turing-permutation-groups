Below is a **literal transcription** of the typed text, preserving the original spacing, punctuation, and apparent typos.  
Where the text is faint, cut off, or unclear, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]` or notes.  
Strikethroughs and diagonal lines (indicating the page may have been crossed out) are **not** shown as strikethrough here;  
rather, the text is reproduced verbatim as typed.

```text
t = 2

We xxxxx find it worth while to apply the principle (ii)
bn a rather larger scale. There are four permutations V
which leave A and C fixed; xxxxx they are

A B C D E F G H
C B A H G F E D
F A D G B E H
A F C H E B G D

From a single permutation wė thus obtain as many as four
xxxx generating isomorphic groups J, e.g. from (BDEFHG)

(BDEFHG)
(BHGFDE)
(FDBGHE)
(FHEBDG)

These may be trnsformed into eculvlent forms, en d the
alphabetically e rliest chosen. We permit taking the reciprocal
as a form of transformation. Thus we get (BDEFH G),(BEDEFGH);
(BGDFEH)? (BDGTHE). By these means we reduce the six-cycles
th at need be considered do wn to 18. As before we ectully
consider first their squares xxxxxx xxxxxx (double threes)
in xx the hope that they will be unexceptionl en d the
six cycle need not be specially investigated.

**Notes:**

- Words like “xxxxx,” “bn,” “en d,” “trnsformed,” “eculvlent,” “e rliest,” “ectully,” etc., are reproduced **exactly** as they appear, retaining spelling and spacing oddities.  
- The permutations (A B C D E F G H / C B A H G F E D / …) and (BDEFHG), (BHGFDE), etc., are laid out as in the source.  
- Some sections labeled “xxxx” are presumably placeholder or uncertain text in the original.
