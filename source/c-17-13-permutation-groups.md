Below is a careful transcription of the typed text exactly as it appears, preserving spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typos or irregularities. Brackets `[…]` indicate uncertain or unreadable portions.

```text
T = 8

This needs r-ther more investigation th-n the previous
cases, partly because it is the l-rgest numebr yet considered,
and partly because it has more factots.

Obviously the permutations which commute with (R) or with
a power of R or generate an intransitive group will be
exceptional. We will consider that we are looking for other
forms of exceptional xxxx upright.

We have various means for dealing with th e permutations.

**Notes:**

- Words like “r-ther,” “th-n,” “l-rgest,” “numebr,” and “factots” appear exactly as typed, with missing or altered letters.  
- The portion “exceptional xxxx upright” is faint and partially obscured; I have rendered the illegible part as “xxxx.”  
- Spacing such as “th e” for “the” is also reproduced verbatim.
