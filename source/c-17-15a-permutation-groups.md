Below is a **best‐effort, verbatim** transcription of the typed page, which is crossed out with diagonal lines.  I have preserved spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typographical quirks in the source, along with bracketed annotations for unclear text.  Since the entire page is struck through, I have not shown each line as struck out (e.g. using strikethrough), but the diagonal lines indicate it was evidently meant to be discarded or revised.

th e analysis rther further. Theorem III effectively enables
us to confine our attention to sequences
where g is constant throughout each coset of C the commutator
group of H. If j represents th e function which is equal to
th e reciprocal of th e index of C, for values in C, and is x
0 outside, then Rj operting on any function converts it into
one which is constant on the cosets, and has no effect applied
to functions already having this property: in fact it averages
over cosets. This operator Rj commutes with all Rp. Also if
xxx and

then
(if g constant in cosets). Thus we can xxxxxx work with f'
instead of f and confine ourselves entirely to functions
constant in the cosets, i.e. effectively to functions
in the factor-group H/C, which is Abelian. We hve thüs
reduced the original problem to the c se of en Abelian group.

**Notes and clarifications:**

- Words like “rther,” “operting,” “th e,” “hve,” “thüs,” “c se,” etc. are reproduced *exactly* as typed, preserving spacing and spelling quirks.  
- The place where “xxx and” appears is partly unclear; it might have been an incomplete sentence or placeholder text.  
- “xxxxx work with f'” is also typed in a way suggesting incomplete or placeholder text.
