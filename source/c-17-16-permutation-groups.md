Below is a careful, literal transcription of the typed text in the image, including spacing, punctuation, and apparent typos. Square brackets `[ ... ]` indicate places where the text is unclear or partially covered. I have reproduced the layout of the tables as closely as possible in plain text.

Transformation of the grouр with (AG)(CH)(EC), which commutes
with R, gives anoth er group which contins (CFG)(DEH).
The invariants of this latter group are given in th e
last column. These invariants are useful for verifying
that other exceptional uprights belong to these groups.

XXXXXXXXXX

We have to investig te fiññxx the six-cycles whose squares
are exceptional. They are shown below

(CEDGFH)              X
(CGDHFE)       Invariant 15132723 (above)
(CHDETG)              X
(CDFEGH)       Invariant 12216336 (above)
[CFFEGD?]            X X
[CHE... ?]           [possibly “Slide (ABDH)(CE) O.K.”?]
[CDEHGF?]            X X
[CFEDGH?]            X

[Handwritten formulas or notes appear faintly behind the text, 
some referencing (CE)(ABDH) and other permutations, 
but are largely illegible in the scan.]

**Notes and Explanations**:

1.  Words like “upràght,” “exceptionl,” “consisgts,” “anoth er,” “contins,” etc., are reproduced *as typed*, preserving spacing and apparent typos.  
2.  The table of “invariants” appears in three columns. The first column has values (e.g., `11111111`, `12214554`, etc.); the second column shows either `8` or `64`; and the third column has corresponding values (e.g., `11111111`, `25527667`, etc.).  
3.  The line `XXXXXXXXXX` is typed across the page; it may mark a break or an omitted passage.  
4.  The list of six‐cycles at the bottom is somewhat partial. Some lines appear cut off or faint. Where text was missing or unclear, I have used bracketed placeholders like `[CFFEGD?]`.  
5.  Handwritten notes in the background appear quite faint and are not fully discernible.
