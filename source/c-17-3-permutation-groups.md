Below is a careful, line‐by‐line transcription of the visible typed text **and** the marginal/handwritten edits in the image. Where something is struck out or inserted by hand, I have used bracketed notes to indicate it. I have also reproduced small bits of Turing’s algebraic notation as best as can be discerned. (Ellipses “…” indicate places where letters or symbols are too unclear to recover exactly.)

Technique for investigating [handwritten above: "any"] particular upright U
```

```
In order to prove H unexceptional it will suffice to prove
that J contains all three-cycles, for if this is so J will
be a self conjugate subgroup of S, and since it is not the
identity it must be either A or S. It would also be sufficient
to prove that J contains all 2-cycles. We shall prove [typed words struck out]
[handwritten "Thereom 1" or "Theorem 1"] If J contains a member of form (α, R^m α)
or (α, R^m α)(β, γ)       where m is prime to T, then it
contains all three-cycles, and in the first case mentioned
all two-cycles. [handwritten note near this: “must be greater than 4.
 (α,R^m α)(β,γ) must … comm …”]
```

```
Suppose J contains (α, R^m α). We will write α_k
for R^(m k)(α). The symbols α_0, α_1, … α_(r-1) include
[typed "the whole" struck out] all the T symbols. Then J contains
[handwritten: “R^( (α_0, α_1 ) ) …” or similar], i.e. (α_s, α_(s+1)), since this is
(α_0, α_2) […] It therefore contains (α_0, α_2) since this
is (α_0, α_2) [handwritten marginal formulas indicating
(α_0, α_2)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1), etc.].
```

```
(if T > 2). It contains (α_0, α_3) which is
(α_0, α_3)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1)(α_2, α_3) […]
and repeating the argument it contain[s] (α_0, α_r)
if T > 3, and repeating the argument it contain[s]
(α_0, α_r) for every α_0 < r. Finally it contains
(α_p1, α_p2) since this is R^(m^p)(α_0, α_2) R^(p^-1)
if ν ≠ pC(T). Thus J contains every
two-cycle (and every three-cycle).
```

**Notes:**

1.  Parenthetical remarks such as “(α_0, α_2)(α_0, α_1)(α_2, α_1)” are handwritten corrections/annotations in the margins.  
2.  Phrases like “must be greater than 4” or “must … comm …” are partial handwritten notes near the main text.  
3.  Where the image is unclear or text is fully struck out, I have inserted bracketed “[…]” or ellipses to indicate uncertain or missing content.
