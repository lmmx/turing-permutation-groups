Frequency distribution of xxxxxxxxx group elements

We now turn to a rather different topic in connection
with the use of identical drums. Even if we know th et all
permutations are possible, will they we equally frequent?
Fortunately we can answer th is in the affirmative. The
problem will be examined under slightly more general conditions.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx No assumptions will be mde about the
relationship between th e generetrors U1... M? UK , and we will not
assume th at the basic group is the symmetric group, but some
other group G.

Let us xxxxxxxxxxx suppose th at we feed xxxxxxxxx
a certin frequency distribution of g'oup elements into
a wheel; how can we c'elulate the frequency distribution of the
group elements at th e output of th e wheel? Let g(a) be the
proportion of the inut elements which re a, and let F(e) be
the proportion of group elements effected by the wheel which are e
(i.e. denoting the order of th e group by h, f(a) := 1/h ∑[v=1..k] [...] ).
Then we get output a if the input is b and the wheel effects
the group element a b^-1, for any b. The proportion of such cases
is f(a b^-1) g(b) , or allowing for the different values of b, a
total proportion of ∑_b f(a b^-1) g(b) . If then we define
the operator Rf by the equation (Rf g)(a) = ∑_b f(a b^-1) g(b) .
We can say that the frequency distribution for n wheels is
given by R^(n-1) f . We wish to determine how this function behave
with increasing n.

**Notes:**

- Words like “th et,” “th is,” “mde,” “generetrors,” “certin,” “c’elulate,” “inut,” “re a,” etc., are reproduced exactly as typed.  
- Sections like “xxxxxxxxxxx” appear to be deliberate placeholders or redacted text in the original.  
- The expression for \( f(a) \) was partially unreadable; I used `[...]` to indicate missing detail.  
- Mathematical symbols (like sums and exponents) have been transcribed in plain text with a caret for superscripts.
