Below is a **line‐by‐line** transcription of both the typed text and the most legible handwritten annotations.  I’ve preserved spacing, punctuation, and any apparent typos or irregularities as faithfully as possible.  Square brackets `[ … ]` indicate portions that are faint, partially obscured, or otherwise uncertain.

We consider the xxxxxx-valued functions in th e group as
forming a xxxxx Euclidean space of h dimensions wh ere h
is the order of the g roup H. We may put (g,k) for
  1    ∑  g(a) k(a)
  — ᵃ
  h
the scalar product, and ‖g‖

for th e xx disten ce [distance?] from the origin.

We may also put  —g [unclear]
  —
  g   =     1   ∑  g(a)
             h  a
for the mean value 1/h ∑ g(a). Schwarz’ inequality gives at once
‖g‖ ≥ —g , and if
we suppose g(a) > 0 on all a, g(a) > 0 some a, we shll
have —g > 0 . We will also suppose f(a) > 0 all/b, f(c) > 0 some a,
f̄ = (?) . Then we hve
Lemma (a)

If f̄ = 1 then ‖R₍g₎ f‖ ≤ ‖f‖ , and equality holds
only if  g(…)/g(x)  is independent of x  for any g, b
for which f(a)≠0 and f(b)≠0.

First note th at
 ( 1/ h²   ∑  g(x) g(c x) )²  ≤  … [handwritten partial math]
 [f(x)c(x)/g(cx)/g(xr)? etc. …]

Then

 ‖R₍g₎ f‖²  =   1/ h²  ∑₍a,b,x₎   f(a b⁻¹) g(b)  f(a x⁻¹) g(x)
              =   1/ h²  ∑₍c,s,x₎  f(c) f(c u) g(u x) g(x)
                        [u := b x⁻¹;  c := a b⁻¹]

            ≤   ∑₍c,s₎ f(c) f(c u)  ‖g‖²
            =   [something] ‖g‖²

equality holding in th e case mentioned. Ths will enable us to …

“Let us define the ‘limiting distribution’ f′ as the

### **Notes and Explanations**:

1.  **Spacing & Typos**: Words such as “th e,” “g roup,” “xx disten ce,” “shll,” etc., are reproduced as typed.  
2.  **Mathematical Expressions**:  
   - The scalar product is shown as \(\frac{1}{h} \sum_a g(a)k(a)\).  
   - A norm \(\|g\|\) is implied, though the definition is partly obscured.  
   - There is mention of “Schwarz’ inequality,” presumably the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in this group‐theoretic setting.  
3.  **Handwritten Annotations**:  
   - Appear mostly in the lower half of the page, rewriting or extending the typed formulas with sums over \(a,b,x\).  
   - Some variable substitutions are given in brackets, e.g. “\(u := b x^{-1}, c := a b^{-1}\).”  
4.  **Ellipses/Unclear Portions**: Where the page is especially faint or partially cut off (e.g. definitions for \(\bar{g}\), or some text after “This will enable us to …”), I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[…]` or notes.  

All told, this is a **best‐effort** rendering of the visible content.
