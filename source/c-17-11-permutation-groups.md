Below is a faithful transcription of the typed text in the image, including spacing and any apparent typos or irregularities (for example, the “±t” instead of “It”).  Square brackets are used for clarifications where something is ambiguous:

The detailed search

T = 1,2,3,4

±t is not difficult to prove that there are no exception l 
groups when T is 1,2 or 3. The case T = 4 needs special 
investigation as it has been expres ly excluded from theorem ±I. 
The exceptional uprights in this case are (1), (13), (24), (13)(24), 
(12)(34), (32)(14), (1234), (4321). The exceptional groups H 
are the identity, the cyclic groups ((1234)), ((13)(24)), the 
four-group, consisting of the identity and all permutations of 
form (α β)(γ δ), and a group isomorphic with the four 
group and generated by (13) and (24).

T = 5
```

**Notes**:

- Where text appears to have minor typographical errors (e.g., “exception l,” “expres ly,” “±t,” “theorem ±I”), I have transcribed them *as is*, preserving spacing and punctuation.  
- Parentheses around permutations (like `(13)`, `(24)`, `(1234)`, `(4321)`) are faithfully reproduced.  
- Greek letters `(α β)(γ δ)` and the set notation `(1), (13), (24), (13)(24), …` are exactly as in the source.
