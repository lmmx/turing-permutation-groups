Below is a careful, line-by-line transcription of the visible typed text and the marginal/handwritten edits in the image. 
Where something is struck out or inserted by hand, bracketed notes indicate it. 
Likewise, small bits of Turing's algebraic notation are reproduced (with unavoidable uncertainty in places). 
Ellipses ``...'' indicate letters or symbols too unclear to recover exactly.

Technique for investigating [handwritten above: ``any''] particular upright \(U\).

In order to prove \(H\) unexceptional it will suffice to prove
that \(J\) contains all three-cycles, for if this is so \(J\) will
be a self conjugate subgroup of \(S\), and since it is not the
identity it must be either \(A\) or \(S\). It would also be sufficient
to prove that \(J\) contains all 2-cycles. We shall prove [typed words struck out]
[handwritten ``Thereom 1'' or ``Theorem 1''] If \(J\) contains a member of form \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\)
or \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)(\beta, \gamma)\) where \(m\) is prime to \(T\), then it
contains all three-cycles, and in the first case mentioned
all two-cycles. [handwritten note near this: ``must be greater than 4.
(\(\alpha, R^m \alpha\))(\(\beta,\gamma\)) must ... comm ...'']

\bigskip

Suppose \(J\) contains \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\). We will write \(\alpha_k\)
for \(R^{m k}(\alpha)\). The symbols \(\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{r-1}\) include
all the \(T\) symbols. Then \(J\) contains
[handwritten: ``\(R^{(\alpha_0, \alpha_1)}\) ...'' or similar], i.e. \((\alpha_s, \alpha_{s+1})\), since this is
\((\alpha_0, \alpha_2)\) [...] It therefore contains \((\alpha_0, \alpha_2)\) since this
is \((\alpha_0, \alpha_2)\) [handwritten marginal formulas indicating
\((\alpha_0, \alpha_2)(\alpha_0, \alpha_1)(\alpha_2, \alpha_1)\), etc.].

\bigskip

(if \(T > 2\)). It contains \((\alpha_0, \alpha_3)\) which is
\((\alpha_0, \alpha_3)(\alpha_0, \alpha_1)(\alpha_2, \alpha_1)(\alpha_2, \alpha_3)\) [...]
and repeating the argument it contains \((\alpha_0, \alpha_r)\)
if \(T > 3\), and repeating the argument it contains
\((\alpha_0, \alpha_r)\) for every \(\alpha_0 < r\). Finally it contains
\((\alpha_{p1}, \alpha_{p2})\) since this is \(R^{(m^p)}(\alpha_0, \alpha_2)\, R^{(p^{-1})}\)
if \(\nu \neq pC(T)\). Thus \(J\) contains every
two-cycle (and every three-cycle).

\bigskip

\textit{Notes:}

1. Parenthetical remarks such as ``(\(\alpha_0, \alpha_2\))(\(\alpha_0, \alpha_1\))(\(\alpha_2, \alpha_1\))'' are handwritten corrections or annotations in the margins.  
2. Phrases like ``must be greater than 4'' or ``must ... comm ...'' are partial handwritten notes near the main text.  
3. Where the image is unclear or text is fully struck out, bracketed ``[...]'' or ellipses indicate uncertain or missing content.

\section{5a}

Below is a best-effort transcription of the handwritten notes. Because they are somewhat informal, spacing and line breaks are preserved where feasible. 
Square brackets \([ \ldots ]\) indicate either an illegible segment, an uncertain reading, or clarifying context. 
Superscripts, subscripts, and negative subscripts appear in math mode (e.g.\ \(\alpha_{-1}\)). 
Parentheses \((\ldots)\) are as in the original notations.

Case 8) \((\alpha_0 \ \alpha_1)(\alpha_2 \ \alpha_{-2})\)

b) \((\alpha_0 \ \alpha_1)(\alpha_{-1} \ \alpha_3)\)

[There is a sketch of circles labeled \(\alpha_0\), \(\alpha_1\), \(\alpha_2\), \(\alpha_3\),
 with arrows from \(\alpha_0 \to \alpha_1 \to \alpha_3\), and so on.]

Then equivalently

\((\alpha_0 \ \alpha_1)(\alpha_2 \ \alpha_{-2})\)  Then [illegible scribbled text]
\((\alpha_3 \ \alpha_{-2})(\alpha_{-1} \ \alpha_{-5}?)\)  [unclear or partially struck out]

gives  \((\alpha_0 \ \alpha_1)(\alpha_2 \ \alpha_{-3})\) if \(T > 7\)

ok

[More heavily scribbled writing follows, indecipherable.]

\bigskip

\textit{Notes:}
- The circle-and-arrow diagram appears to show some permutation cycles or orbits labeled ``\(\alpha_0\), \(\alpha_1\), \(\alpha_2\), \(\alpha_3\),'' along with possibly arrows indicating transitions.  
- Negative subscripts like ``\(\alpha_{-1}\)'' or ``\(\alpha_{-2}\)'' appear as part of Turing's notation.  
- The last lines are almost fully scribbled out, so their precise content cannot be recovered.

\section{5}

Below is a careful line-by-line rendering of both the typed text and the handwritten/marginal notes visible in your image.  
Where words or symbols are too faint or otherwise unclear, bracketed ellipses ``[...]'' or notes indicate this.  
Strikethrough text is shown with ``~~...~~,'' and handwritten insertions or comments appear in square brackets.

(\text{handwritten note near ``$\alpha_2, \alpha_3$''}:
  ``3 different ??? for $x_2, x_3$'')

d) \((\alpha_0, \alpha_1)(\beta, \beta')\) belongs to \(J,\) where ~~are all different.~~ 
([\text{handwritten note}: ``$\beta$ different ???''])

It is easily seen th\ t cases b) and c) are essentially

[handwritten arrows and notes continuing the algebra, for example]
\(= (\alpha_0, \alpha_1)(\beta)(\alpha_0, \alpha_2)(\beta') \ldots\)
\(\text{does } (\alpha_0, \alpha_1)(\beta)(\alpha_0, \alpha_2)(\beta') = \ldots\)

\bigskip

\textit{Notes:}
- Lines c) and d) ended with ``are all different.'' in the typescript, struck through.  
- Marginal notes about ``3 different ??? for \(\alpha_2, \alpha_3\)'' are handwritten, only partially legible.  
- The final lines (``It is easily seen ...'') are partially crossed out, so text about ``and that e) and f) are the same'' is partly visible.  The subsequent permutations in parentheses are mostly in pen.

Below is a faithful transcription of the typed text in the image, including spacing and any apparent typos or irregularities (for example, ``Â±t'' instead of ``It''). 
Square brackets are used for clarifications where something is ambiguous:

\(\pm t\) is very easy to apply theorem II. We my first express 
\(U, UR, UR^2\) etc., in cycles: this my be done for inst nce by 
writin g the alph bet out double and also writing out 
the sequence \(UA, UB, \ldots UZ\). By putting the former above the 
letter in v rious positions we get th e permut tions n \(UR^s\). 
Among these we may look for permut tions which h ave a three 
cycle end all other cycles of length pr me to 3. By r ising this 
to an ppropri te power we obt in e three cycle which my or my 
not satisfy the conditions in theorem II. If we are not 
suc cesful we may use other permut tions in \(H J\). We may also 
be able in e similer way to generate e permut tion which j

In cycles it is \((AMOWHRCYUZISJLXVDTQPK)(BNEF)(G) = U\). 
Then \(U^{22} := (BE)(NF)\). 

\bigskip

The distance BE is 3, which is prime to 26. The dist nce NF is 
8. Hence theorem II applies, end \(J\) includesthe whole of \(A,\) 
and therefore \(H\) includes \(A\).

The detailed search

\(T = 1,2,3,4\)

\(\pm t\) is not difficult to prove that there are no exception l 
groups when \(T\) is 1,2 or 3. The case \(T=4\) needs special 
investigation as it has been expres ly excluded from theorem \(\pm I\). 
The exceptional uprights in this case are \((1), (13), (24), (13)(24),\) 
\((12)(34), (32)(14), (1234), (4321)\). The exceptional groups \(H\) 
are the identity, the cyclic groups \(((1234)), ((13)(24))\), the 
four-group, consisting of the identity and all permutations of 
form \((\alpha \ \beta)(\gamma \ \delta)\), and a group isomorphic with the four 
group and generated by \((13)\) and \((24)\).

\(T = 8\)

This needs r-ther more investigation th-n the previous
cases, partly because it is the l-rgest numebr yet considered,
and partly because it has more factots.

Obviously the permutations which commute with \((R)\) or with
a power of \(R\) or generate an intransitive group will be
exceptional. We will consider that we are looking for other
forms of exceptional xxxx upright.

We have various means for dealing with th e permutations.

what is to be done withthe var\`{o}us classes of conjugates in
the symmetric group.

Double threes. Th ese pre arr nged in pairs (as transformed

Triple twos. Very few of these n eed to be considered in

on a slide, and so are either O.K.\ under d) or equivalent to
a double three. Those with the pair \((DH)\),re reduced to a
\(t=4\) case under a), and those with the pair \((GG)\) are paired with
ones having \((DH)\).

Four-and-twos need only be considered when their squares are
intransitive \(\beta\) or commute with \(R^4\) by theorem II.

Other cases consist of ones wh ree th ree or more letters [...]

th e analysis rther further. Theorem III effectively enables
us to confine our attention to sequences
where g is constant throughout each coset of C the commutator
group of H. If j represents th e function which is equal to
th e reciprocal of th e index of C, for values in C, and is x
0 outside, then \(Rj\) operting on any function converts it into
one which is constant on the cosets, and has no effect applied
to functions already having this property: in fact it averages
over cosets. This operator \(Rj\) commutes with all \(Rp\). Also if

instead of \(f\) and confine ourselves entirely to functions
constant in the cosets, i.e.\ effectively to functions
in the factor-group \(H/C\), which is Abelian. We hve thÃ¼s
reduced the original problem to the c se of en Abelian group.

i.e. (3,f\(_1\)) is satisfied. Also
\[
\chi_a\bigl(a^{-1} \, r_a \, (a \, b)\bigr)
  = \chi_a\bigl(\chi_a(\chi_a^{-1} b)\bigr)

[handwritten marks here]

so that (3,f\(_1\), \(a^{-1} r_a, b\)) is satisfied. But if (3,f\(_1\), \(s_i, r_i, b\))
are satisfied for all \(b\) then (3,f\(_1\), \(r_s, b\)) is satisfied for all \(b\).
Consequently (3,f\(_1\)) is satisfied and the corollary to theorem 1 applies.

In the cases when the centre of \(\mathfrak{M}\) consists either of the
identity alone or of the whole group there is always a solution
of the equations (6). The expressions on the right h nd sides
of these equations always represent centre elements, so that
in the case where the centre consists of the identity alone,
there is a solution by putting \(\zeta_i = 1\) for each \(i\). If \(\mathfrak{M}\) is Abelian

Frequency distribution of xxxxxxxxx group elements

We now turn to a rather different topic in connection
with the use of identical drums. Even if we know th et all
permutations are possible, will they we equally frequent?
Fortunately we can answer th is in the affirmative. The
problem will be examined under slightly more general conditions.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx No assumptions will be mde about the
relationship between th e generetrors \(U_1 \ldots M? U_K\), and we will not
assume th at the basic group is the symmetric group, but some
other group \(G\).

Let us xxxxxxxxxxx suppose th at we feed xxxxxxxxx
a certin frequency distribution of g'oup elements into
a wheel; how can we c'elulate the frequency distribution of the
group elements at th e output of the wheel? Let \(g(a)\) be the
proportion of the inut elements which re \(a\), and let \(F(e)\) be
the proportion of group elements effected by the wheel which are \(e\).
Then we get output \(a\) if the input is \(b\) and the wheel effects
the group element \(a b^{-1}\). The proportion of such cases
is \(f(a b^{-1})\, g(b)\), or allowing for the different values of \(b\), a
total proportion of \(\sum_b f(a b^{-1})\, g(b)\). If then we define
the operator \(R_f\) by the equation
\[
(R_f\, g)(a) \;=\; \sum_b f(a b^{-1})\, g(b),
\]
we can say that the frequency distribution for \(n\) wheels is
given by \(R_f^{\,n-1} \,f\). We wish to determine how this function behaves
with increasing \(n\).

We may also put \(\overline{g} = \frac{1}{h}\,\sum_a g(a)\).
Schwarz' inequality gives at once
\(\Vert g\Vert \ge \overline{g}\), and if
we suppose \(g(a) > 0\) on all \(a\), \(g(a) > 0\) some \(a\), we shll
have \(\overline{g} > 0\). We will also suppose \(f(a) > 0\) all/b, \(f(c) > 0\) some \(a\),

\textbf{Theorem III}

The limiting distributions for \(f\) are constant throughout
the cosets of a certain self-conjugate subgroup \(H_1\) of \(H\). \(H_1\)
consists of all expressions xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
of the form \(U_{m_1}\,U_{m_2}\,\ldots\,U_{m_p}\) where the sum \(\sum m_i = 0\). The factor
group \(H / H_1\) is cyclic. In the case each [typed text unclear]
\(g\) is \(f\) the limiting distributions have the value \(\theta\) except
in one coset of \(H_1\).

Let \(k\) be a limiting distribution. Let it be the limit of
the sequence \(R_f^r g_s, R_f^r g_j, R_f^r g\ldots\)
then [some text about norms] \(\Vert R_f^{\,n+1} g\Vert / \Vert R_f^{\,n} g\Vert > \ldots\)
Now \(\Vert R_f^{\,n} g\Vert / \Vert k\Vert \to \ldots\)
tends to the limit 1 as \(n\) tends to infinity, and therefore
\(\Vert R_f^{\,n+1} g\Vert / \Vert R_f^{\,n} g\Vert\) tends to 1. But \(\Vert R_f\,u\Vert / \Vert u\Vert\)
is a continuous function of \(u\) and therefore xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
limit of the sequence \(\ldots \Vert R_f^k / \Vert k\Vert = 1\)

Applying lemma (a\(\Phi\)) to this we see th t there is a function
\(\phi_\ell(4)\), defined for all expressions of form \(a\,b^{-1}\) where \(f(a)\neq 0\)
\(f(b)\neq 0\) such th t \(\bigl(\phi(y\,x) : \phi(y)(k\,x)\bigr) = \ldots\).
By applying the same argument with \(R_f^n\) in place of \(f\) we find that
there is a function \(\phi_n(4)\) defined for all expressions
of form \(a_1\,a_2\,\ldots\,a_k\,b^{-1}\,b_k^{-1}\ldots b_1^{-1}\) where \(f(a_1)f(a_2)\ldots f(h_k) \neq 0\),
such that \(\phi_n(xy) = \phi_n(x)\phi_n(y)\).
Whenever \(\phi_n(4)\) is defined. The various functions \(\phi_n(4)\)
must agree wherever their domains overlap, and
they may therefore be all represented by one symbol \(\phi\). In
fact we may say that \(\phi(x)\) is defined and has the value \(\times\)
whenever \(g(x):= \alpha \ldots\). It now appears that the domain
of definition of \(\phi(g)\) is a group, for if [handwritten: ``\(\phi(4,x) = \alpha, \phi(x)=\ldots\)'' etc.]

and \(k(u_2, x) \ge k(x)\) all \(x\), then \(k(u_1, u_2 x?): \phi(u_1)k(u_2 x?): \phi(u_1), \phi(u_2), \phi(k(x))\)
all \(x\). Thus if \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) belong to the domain of
definition of \(\phi\) so does \(y_1 y_2\) and \(\phi(u_1, y_1, y_2): \phi(u_1, y_2)(\phi(y_2?))\). It
is now immediately seen that the domain of definition is \(H_1\).

The function \(\phi\) is a one dimensional representation of \(H_1\),
but it is real and positive and therefore has the value 1
last throughout \(H_1\). This argument may also be expressed without the
use of representation theory thus. Since \(H_1\) is finite any
element \(y\) of it satisfies an equation \(y^m = 1,\) therefore
~~((\(\phi(4)\))\(^m \cdot \phi(4^m)=1\) isn't non sen e   non . negativity \(\phi(y)>0\), so \(\phi(4)>1\)~~
But since \(g(x)\) is always ~~positive~~ [handwritten: ``non-negative''] ~~and so~~
this implies that \(g(x)\) is constant throughout each coset of \(H\).

It now only remains to investigate the c\(\sim\)her\(\sim\)racter of the
group \(H_1\). It is easily seen to be self-invariant or self-conjugate, 
since if \(a b a^{-1}\) belongs to \(H_1,\) and \(b\in H\), 
the total of exponents of group generators \(U_r\) in \(a b a^{-1}\) must be 0, 
those in \(a^{-1}\) canceling with those in \(a\). 
Hence \(a b a^{-1}\) belongs to \(H_1\).

Now let us take a particular generator \(U_1\). Then the cosets
\(H_1 U_1^m\) exhaust the group \(H\). For if \(p\) is an element of \(H\) it will
be a product of generators; let the total of exponents be \(m\).
Then \(U_1^{-m}\) has total exponents 0, en d so belongs to \(H_1\). 
i.e. \([a \text{ belongs to } H_1 U_1^m.]\)

If \(U_1^s\) is the lowest power of \(U_1\) which
belongs to \(H_1\) then \(H/H_1\) is evidently isomorphic with the
cyclic group of order \(s\).

In the c se th t \(g\) is \(f,\) all the
group elements for which \(R_f^{(n-1)} xxxxx\) is not zero are products
of \(n\) generators en d th erefore belong to \(H_1 U_1^n.\)

\textbf{Example}

As an example let us consider the quaternion group
consisting of \(1, i, j, k, i', j', k'\), with the table

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
   & i & j & k & i' & j' & k' & \dots \\
\hline
i' & k' & j' & i  & k  & j  & \dots & \\
k' & j  & i' & \dots &   &    &       & \\
j' & i  & k' & \dots &   &    &       & \\
\vdots &  &   &      &   &    &       & 
\end{array}
\]
(and so on, rows/columns for \(1,i,j,k,i',j',k'\)\, ...)

and let \(U_1\) be \(i\) and \(U_2\) be \(j\). The various functions \(R_f^n f\)
are given in the table below

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
  n & i & i' & j & j' & k & k' \\
\hline
 1 & \tfrac{1}{2} & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 2 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} & \tfrac{1}{2} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} \\
 3 & 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} & 0 & \tfrac{1}{4} & 0 & \dots \\
 4 & \dots & & & & & \\
 5 & \dots & & & & & \\
 6 & \dots & & & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

It is seen th t the group \(H_1\) is the group generated by \(k\),
it has factor group which is cyclic of order 2.

Case of sym metric and alternating groups

In the case under consider tion at th e beginning of our
analy sis, \(H\) was ~~unless the upright \(U\) was ex ceptl~~ eith er the symmetric or the
alternating group. In this case \(H_1\) is xxxxxxx also either
the symmetric or th e altern ting group, for it is self
conjugate in \(H\). It will b e the xxxxxxx group if the
generators are all of th e s me r rity, and the symmetric group
otherwise.

We th erefore conclude th t when th e uprigh t is not

wheels are uniform throughout the alternating group (even perms).
If odd permutations are possible with the given uprigh t and
number of wheels th e distribution is uniform th roughout
th e symmetric group (all perms).
