Below is a best‐effort transcription of the handwritten notes in your image.  Because they are somewhat informal, I have preserved spacing and line breaks where feasible.  Square brackets `[...]` indicate either an illegible segment, an uncertain reading, or clarifying context I have added.  Superscripts, subscripts, and negative subscripts are reproduced using plain text if they are clearly visible.  Parentheses `( … )` are used as in the original notations.

```
Case 8)    (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₂)
b)         (α₀ α₁)(α₋₁ α₃)

[There is a sketch of circles labeled α₀, α₁, α₂, α₃,
 with arrows from α₀ → α₁ → α₃, and so on.]

Then equivalently

 (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₂)  Then [illegible scribbled text]
 (α₃ α₋₂)(α₋₁ α₋₅?)  [unclear or partially struck out]

gives  (α₀ α₁)(α₂ α₋₃)   if T > 7
ok

[More heavily scribbled writing follows, indecipherable.]

**Notes:**

- The circle‐and‐arrow diagram appears to show some permutation cycles or orbits labeled “α₀,” “α₁,” “α₂,” and “α₃,” along with perhaps one or two arrows indicating transitions.  
- Negative subscripts like “α₋₁” or “α₋₂” appear to be part of Turing’s notation.  
- The last lines are almost fully scribbled out, so their precise content cannot be recovered.
