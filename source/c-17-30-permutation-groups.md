Below is a **line‐by‐line** transcription, preserving the typed text and capturing any clearly legible handwritten edits.  
Where the typed text is partially obscured or too faint, I have inserted bracketed ellipses `[...]`.  
Handwritten insertions or corrections appear in square brackets `[handwritten: ...]`.  
Strikethrough text is shown with `~~...~~`.

and k(u₂, x) ≥ k(x)   all x, then  k(u₁, u₂ x?) : φ(u₁)k(u₂ x?): φ(u₁), φ(u₂), φ(k(x))
all x. Thus if   y₁  and  y₂  belong to the domain of
definition of  φ  so does  y₁ y₂  and  φ(u₁, y₁, y₂): φ(u₁, y₂)(φ(y₂?)). It
is now immediately seen that the domain of definition is H₁.

The function  φ  is a one dimensional representation of H₁,
b ut it is real and positive and therefore has the value 1
last throughout H₁. This argument may also be expressed without the
use of representation theory thus. Since H₁ is finite any
element y of it satisfies an equation y^m = 1, ~~en d~~ therefore
~~((φ(4))^m · φ(4^m)=1 isnon sen e   non . negativity φ(y)>0, and so φ(4)>1~~
But since  g(x)  is always ~~positive~~ [handwritten: "non‐negative"?] ~~and so~~
this implies that  g(x)  is constant throughout each coset of H.

It now only remains to investigate the c∼her∼racter of the
group H₁. It is easily seen to be self‐conjugate, since if  a b a⁻¹
belon gs to H₁, and  b  to H, th e total of exponents of
group generators Uᵣ  in  a b a⁻¹  must be 0, those in  a⁻¹
can celling with those in  a ; hence  a b a⁻¹  belongs to H₁
[handwritten note: “(H₁ is self‐invariant?), if a, b ∈ H, does? Yes.”]

Now let us take a particular generator U₁ say. Then the cosets
H₁ U₁^m  exhaust the group H. For if p is an element of H it will
be a product of generators; let the total of exponents be m.
Then U₁⁻ᵐ has total exponents 0, en d so belongs to H₁, i.e.
[a belongs to H₁ U₁^m. Possibly a typed line: “is. then units co hand? H?” is unclear]

If  U₁^s  is the lowest power of U₁ which
belon gs ~~mto~~ H₁ then H/H₁ is evidently isomorphic with the
cyclic group of order s.

In the c se th t g is f, ~~or alternatively, if g is the o
identical distribution, g(1)=1, g(e)=0 otherwise~~ all the
group elements for which  Rᵖ⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾ xxxxx  is not zero are products
of n generators en d th erefore belong to H₁ U₁^n. ~~~~~

### **Notes & Clarifications**:

1. **Spacing & Typos**: Words like “belon gs,” “c∼her∼racter,” “en d,” etc., are reproduced exactly as typed, including any spacing irregularities.  
2. **Handwritten Insertions**: Bracketed notes such as `[handwritten: "non‐negative"?]` reflect possible clarifications.  
3. **Strikethrough**: The typed portion “((φ(4))^m · φ(4^m)=1...” was partially struck out; I’ve marked it with `~~...~~`. The same goes for “or alternatively, if g is the o identical distribution…” near the end.  
4. **Marginal Notes**: The note “[(H₁ is self‐invariant?), if a, b ∈ H, does? Yes.]” is a handwritten comment or check.  
5. **Incomplete or Faint Lines**: Where lines are completely unreadable or obviously partial, I have used `[...]`.  

This transcription is a **best‐effort** representation of what is visible in the scan.
