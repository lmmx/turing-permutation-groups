Below is an **outline** of the document, section by section, describing what each segment covers and occasionally citing specific results or statements. The focus here is on the **text’s own content**—what it does or shows in each section—without broader context or motives.

---

### **Section 3 (c-17-3-permutation-groups)**
- **Topic**: A technique for investigating a particular “upright” \(U\).  
- **Key Point**: States that to prove a group \(H\) is “unexceptional,” it suffices to show that a certain subgroup \(J\) contains all three‐cycles or all two‐cycles.  
- **Claim**: *“Theorem 1”* is introduced (handwritten), asserting that if \(J\) contains an element of the form \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)\) or \((\alpha, R^m \alpha)(\beta, \gamma)\) (with \(m\) prime to \(T\)), then \(J\) contains all three‐cycles (and in one case all two‐cycles).

---

### **Section 5a (c-17-5a-permutation-groups)**
- **Content**: Transcription of **handwritten** notes only (no typed text here).  
- **Focus**: Cases involving products of two‐cycles, e.g. \((\alpha_0 \alpha_1)(\alpha_2 \alpha_{-2})\).  
- **Observations**: Includes small sketches (circles/arrows) showing how these two‐cycles relate. Heavily scribbled areas near the end are not fully decipherable.

---

### **Section 5 (c-17-5-permutation-groups)**
- **Topic**: Typed text with marginal notes about specific permutations like \((\alpha_0, \alpha_2)(\alpha_2, \alpha_3)\).  
- **Struck‐Through Portions**: Original text about “are all different” is crossed out.  
- **Marginal Notes**: Indicate partial clarifications (e.g., “3 different ??? for \(\alpha_2, \alpha_3\)”), plus references to small algebraic checks that confirm whether two permutations combine as stated.

---

### **Section 7 (c-17-7-permutation-groups)**
- **Main Discussion**: Applying “theorem II” to permutations \(U, UR, UR^2, \dots\) expressed in cycles.  
- **Method**: Lays out a typed approach to writing out alphabets double, then identifying the permutations in cycle form.  
- **Example**: An upright chosen at random (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ MNYTFBGRSLAKOEWKPCJQZDHVUI`), which yields a cycle decomposition `(AMOWHRCYUZISJLXVDTQPK)(BNEF)(G)` and leads to a demonstration that certain two‐cycles imply “theorem II applies.”

---

### **Section 11 (c-17-11-permutation-groups)**
- **Focus**: *Detailed search* for small values \(T = 1, 2, 3, 4\).  
- **Result**: Notes that for \(T=1,2,3\), there are no exceptional groups. Then enumerates exceptional uprights for \(T=4\) (e.g. \((1), (13), (24), (13)(24), \dots\)) and describes corresponding exceptional groups (e.g. the identity, certain cyclic groups, the four‐group, etc.).

---

### **Section 13 (c-17-13-permutation-groups)**
- **Topic**: Case \(T=8\). The text says it “needs r-ther more investigation” than earlier \(T\) cases.  
- **Reason**: \(T=8\) is a larger number with more factors, so there is a broader set of permutations to check.  
- **Approach**: Considers permutations that commute with \((R)\) or generate an intransitive group (classifying them as “exceptional”), then looks for “other forms” that might also be exceptional.

---

### **Section 14 (c-17-14-permutation-groups)**
- **Content**: Mentions how to indicate whether a permutation is “O.K.” or fails, referencing the value of some “commut•tor.”  
- **Plan**: If none of the standard checks classify a permutation as O.K., it goes to a further query stage.  
- **Technical Notes**: Discussion of “666cycles,” “double threes,” “triple twos,” and how they reduce under group transformations.

---

### **Section 15a (c-17-15a-permutation-groups)**
- **State**: Entire page is crossed out with diagonal lines.  
- **Typed Text**: Talks about “Theorem III” enabling one to restrict to functions constant on cosets of the commutator group \(C\).  
- **Abelian Factor**: Notes that once you restrict to the factor‐group \(H/C\), you effectively deal with an Abelian group.  
- **Likely Revision**: The crossing out suggests Turing replaced or reorganized this argument later.

---

### **Section 16 (c-17-16-permutation-groups)**
- **Content**: States \((CDF)(EGH)\) is an “exceptionl” upright, giving a table of “invariants” for the group.  
- **Tables**: Shows columns of numeric invariants (e.g. `11111111`, `12214554`, etc.), total element counts, and a transformation of the group under \((AG)(CH)(EC)\).  
- **Purpose**: Checking whether certain six‐cycles’ squares are also exceptional, listing them and their invariants.

---

### **Section 19a (c-17-19a-permutation-groups)**
- **State**: Another crossed‐out page with diagonal lines.  
- **Text**: Includes references to products of terms like \(\prod b_i^{-1} r_i^{s_i} b_i\) and arguments about center elements or expansions.  
- **Conclusion**: The final lines talk about needing to solve certain equations (6) or find all relations (7) in a group context, but the page is evidently superseded or abandoned.

---

### **Section 20 (c-17-20-permutation-groups)**
- **Topic**: Case \(t=2\).  
- **Method**: Applies “the principle (ii) on a rather larger scale,” discussing permutations \(V\) that leave \(A\) and \(C\) fixed.  
- **Tables**: Lists four permutations and shows how from a single permutation, one might generate four isomorphic groups. Summarizes transformations (“Slide,” “reciprocal,” etc.) to reduce the search to fewer cases.

---

### **Section 21 (c-17-21-permutation-groups)**
- **Content**: A list of “Six cycles and double-threes,” each line describing a permutation (like \((BDEFHG)\)) plus a short note (e.g. “Slide (ACG)(BFDHE) O.K.”).  
- **Invariant Mentions**: Some permutations are said to have an “Invariant 34657564, giving group \(K'\).”  
- **Follow‐Up**: Once the squares (“double threes”) are deemed unexceptional or accounted for, the text checks if the original six‐cycles themselves could be exceptional.

---

### **Section 22 (c-17-22-permutation-groups)**
- **Heading**: “Triple Twos,” followed by “Four and twos and fours.”  
- **Handwritten List**: Several permutations composed of three disjoint 2‐cycles, each with notes on whether it is intransitive, slides to something else, or is “O.K.”  
- **Second Part**: Summaries of four‐and‐two permutations, with quick checks about intransitivity or commuting with \(R^4\).

---

### **Section 27 (c-17-27-permutation-groups)**
- **Shift in Topic**: Considers a “frequency distribution” of group elements in connection with identical drums.  
- **Question**: Whether all permutations are *equally* frequent if the group is large.  
- **Method**: Introduces an operator \(R_f\) that transforms one distribution into another, analyzing how the distribution behaves under repeated application of these group‐based operations.

---

### **Section 28 (c-17-28-permutation-groups)**
- **Mathematical Setup**: Real‐valued functions on a group, forming a Euclidean space.  
- **Scalar Product**: Defined as \(\frac{1}{h} \sum_a g(a)k(a)\). Norms (\(\|g\|\)) and mean values (\(\bar{g}\)) are introduced.  
- **Lemma (a)**: States an inequality involving \(\|R_{(g)} f\|\) and \(\|f\|\), with equality conditions. Partway through, typed lines become faint or partially crossed out.

---

### **Section 29 (c-17-29-permutation-groups)**
- **“Theorem III”**: Describes “limiting distributions” that are constant on cosets of a self‐conjugate subgroup \(H_1\).  
- **Argument**: Uses sequences \(\|R_f^n g\|\) and continuity arguments to show that in the limit, the distribution does not change.  
- **Function \(\phi\)**: Introduces a function that might be a 1‐dimensional representation of \(H_1\); concluding it must be trivial (value 1) if certain conditions hold.

---

### **Section 30 (c-17-30-permutation-groups)**
- **Content**: Continues the discussion of the subgroup \(H_1\).  
- **Key Point**: Once \(H_1\) is shown finite and self‐conjugate, any element’s exponent sums within that subgroup must total 0, implying certain coset structures.  
- **Result**: If a generating element \(U_1^s\) belongs to \(H_1\), then \(H/H_1\) is cyclic of order \(s\). The final lines talk about “products of generators” belonging to a specific coset.

---

### **Section 31 (c-17-31-permutation-groups)**
- **Example**: The *quaternion group* with elements \(\{1, i, j, k, i', j', k'\}\).  
- **Tables**: Shows a partial multiplication table and a smaller table of numeric values (e.g., “1: i=½, i'=½…”).  
- **Observation**: Identifies a subgroup \(H_1\) generated by \(k\), with a factor group that is cyclic of order 2.

---

### **Section 32a (c-17-32a-permutation-groups)**
- **Handwriting**: Simply the heading “On Permutation Groups.”  
- **Typed Text**: Too faint to decipher beyond tiny fragments.  
- **No Additional Detail**: Essentially empty apart from the title and a note that reversed text is not legible.

---

### **Section 32 (c-17-32-permutation-groups)**
- **Topic**: “Case of sym metric and alternating groups.”  
- **Conclusions**: If an upright is not exceptional, the group in question (with many wheels) becomes either the alternating group (even permutations only) or the full symmetric group (all permutations), depending on certain generator parity.  
- **Phrase**: *“If odd permutations are possible… then the distribution is uniform throughout the symmetric group.”*  

---

#### **Overall Internal Structure**

- **First Segments (Sections 3–22)**: Deal with identifying conditions under which a group or upright is “exceptional” or “unexceptional,” using cycle decompositions, prime factors, and transformations (slides, intransitivity, commutations).  
- **Middle Sections (27–30)**: Shift focus to analyzing repeated applications of an operator \(R_f\) on distributions of group elements, culminating in “Theorem III” about limiting distributions and subgroups.  
- **Examples (Sections 31–32)**: Show specific illustrations (the quaternion group, the symmetric vs. alternating group) and final statements about uniform distributions if the upright is unexceptional.

All of this is presented in typed text with occasional **handwritten** clarifications, expansions on permutations, and some pages crossed out or left incomplete.
